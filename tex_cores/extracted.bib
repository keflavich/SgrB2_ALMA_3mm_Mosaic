  abstract =      {Context. We model the dust and free-free continuum
                   emission in the high-mass star-forming region
                   Sagittarius B2. Aims: We want to reconstruct the 3D
                   density and dust temperature distribution, as a
                   crucial input to follow-up studies of the gas
                   velocity field and molecular abundances. Methods: We
                   employ the 3D radiative transfer program RADMC-3D to
                   calculate the dust temperature self-consistently,
                   providing a given initial density distribution. This
                   density distribution of the entire cloud complex is
                   then recursively reconstructed, based on available
                   continuum maps, including both single-dish and
                   high-resolution interferometric maps that cover a
                   wide frequency range (nu = 40 GHz-4 THz). The model
                   covers spatial scales from 45 pc down to 100 au,
                   i.e., a spatial dynamic range of 105. Results: We
                   find that the density distribution of Sagittarius B2
                   can be reasonably well fitted by applying a
                   superposition of spherical cores with Plummer-like
                   density profiles. To reproduce the spectral energy
                   distribution, we position Sgr B2(N) along the line of
                   sight behind the plane containing Sgr B2(M). We find
                   that the entire cloud complex comprises a total gas
                   mass of 8.0 × 106 M&sun; within a diameter of 45 pc.
                   This corresponds to an averaged gas density of 170
                   M&sun; pc-3. We estimate stellar masses of 2400
                   M&sun; and 20 700 M&sun; and luminosities of 1.8 ×
                   106 L&sun; and 1.2 × 107 L&sun; for Sgr B2(N) and
                   Sgr B2(M), respectively. We report H2 column
                   densities of 2.9 × 1024 cm-2 for Sgr B2(N) and 2.5
                   × 1024 cm-2 for Sgr B2(M) in a 40'' beam. For Sgr
                   B2(S), we derive a stellar mass of 1100 M&sun;, a
                   luminosity of 6.6 × 105 L&sun;, and an H2 column
                   density of 2.2 × 1024 cm-2 in a 40'' beam. We
                   calculate a star formation efficiency of 5% for Sgr
                   B2(N) and 50% for Sgr B2(M). This indicates that most
                   of the gas content in Sgr B2(M) has already been
                   converted to stars or dispersed.},

                   number is discussed. The search found three new weak
                   masers whose energy sources are probably B stars.
                   Possible explanations are a different initial mass
                   function at the center, suppressed maser emission, or
                   stochastic bursts of star formation. The first, which
                   holds that the lack of masers is due to a lack of
                   massive stars, seems incompatible with the Lyman
                   photon flux from the area. The second, which calls
                   for disruption of masers by passing bulge stars, is
                   valid only out to a few pc from the galactic nucleus
                   and is therefore unsatisfactory. The third
                   explanation is plausible. If star formation at the
                   center is not governed by a large-scale mechanism,
                   star formation there is then stochastic and may now
                   be in a lull. All the water masers from the most
                   recently formed stars would by now have died out.},

                   harbors a variety of phenomena unique to the central
                   environment. This review discusses the observed
                   structure and activity of the interstellar medium in
                   this region in terms of its inevitable inflow toward
                   the center of the Galactic gravitational potential
                   well. A number of dissipative processes lead to a
                   strong concentration of gas into a "Central Molecular
                   Zone" of about 200-pc radius, in which the molecular
                   medium is characterized by large densities, large
                   velocity dispersions, high temperatures, and
                   apparently strong magnetic fields. The physical state
                   of the gas and the resultant star formation processes
                   occurring in this environment are therefore quite
                   unlike those occurring in the large-scale disk. Gas
                   not consumed by star formation either enters a hot X
                   ray-emitting halo and is lost as a thermally driven
                   galactic wind or continues moving inward, probably
                   discontinuously, through the domain of the few
                   parsec-sized circumnuclear disks and eventually into
                   the central parsec. There, the central radio source
                   SgrA* currently accepts only a tiny fraction of the
                   inflowing material, likely as a result of a limit
                   cycle wherein the continual inflow of matter provokes
                   star formation, which in turn can temporarily halt
                   the inflow via mass-outflow winds.},

                   (submm) continuum emission tracing the cold dust of
                   dense and young star-forming regions. Here, we
                   present the overall distribution of sources within
                   our Galactic disk. The submm continuum emission is
                   confined to a narrow range around the Galactic plane,
                   but shifted on average by ~0.07 deg below the plane.
                   Source number counts show strong enhancements toward
                   the Galactic center, the spiral arms, and toward
                   prominent star-forming regions. Comparing the
                   distribution of ATLASGAL dust continuum emission to
                   that of young intermediate- to high-mass young
                   stellar objects (YSOs) derived from Spitzer data, we
                   find similarities as well as differences. In
                   particular, the distribution of submm dust continuum
                   emission is significantly more confined to the plane
                   than the YSO distribution (FWHM of 0.7 and 1.1 deg,
                   corresponding to mean physical scale heights of
                   approximately 46 and 80 pc, respectively). While this
                   difference may partly be caused by the large
                   extinction from the dense submm cores, gradual
                   dispersal of stellar distributions after their birth
                   could also contribute to this effect. Compared to
                   other tracers of Galactic structure, the ATLASGAL
                   data are strongly confined to a narrow latitude strip
                   around the Galactic plane.},

                   whether new high-mass stars are forming in this

                   the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope
                   and at 8.4 GHz with the Very Large Array. We
                   complement our data with recent maser and
                   mid-infrared results. The ridge's clouds are dark at
                   mid-infrared wavelengths, indicating the presence of
                   cold, high column density material. In combination
                   with existing temperature measurements in the dust
                   ridge, we determine masses of the largest clouds. The
                   results show that the dust ridge contains a very
                   massive reservoir of molecular material. We find five
                   radio continuum sources at 8.4 GHz in the general
                   dust ridge vicinity, but outside of the dust ridge

                   previous observations, no signs of star formation are

                   studying how their final stellar populations are
                   assembled from their natal progenitor gas clouds can
                   provide strong constraints on star formation
                   theories. An obvious place to look for the initial
                   conditions of such extreme stellar clusters is gas
                   clouds of comparable mass and density, with no star
                   formation activity. We present a method to identify
                   such progenitor gas clouds and demonstrate the
                   technique for the gas in the inner few hundred pc of
                   our Galaxy. The method highlights three clouds in the
                   region with similar global physical properties to the
                   previously identified extreme cloud, G0.253 + 0.016,
                   as potential young massive cluster (YMC) precursors.
                   The fact that four potential YMC progenitor clouds
                   have been identified in the inner 100 pc of the
                   Galaxy, but no clouds with similar properties have
                   been found in the whole first quadrant despite
                   extensive observational efforts, has implications for
                   cluster formation/destruction rates across the
                   Galaxy. We put forward a scenario to explain how such
                   dense gas clouds can arise in the Galactic Centre
                   environment, in which YMC formation is triggered by
                   gas streams passing close to the minimum of the
                   global Galactic gravitational potential at the
                   location of the central supermassive black hole, Sgr
                   A*. If this triggering mechanism can be verified, we
                   can use the known time interval since closest
                   approach to Sgr A* to study the physics of stellar
                   mass assembly in an extreme environment as a function

                   Milky Way is a star formation (SF) environment with
                   very extreme physical properties. Exploration of SF
                   in this region is important because (i) this region
                   allows us to test models of star formation under
                   exceptional conditions; and (ii) the CMZ clouds might

                   physics of starburst galaxies in the nearby and the
                   distant universe. For this reason we launched the
                   Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS), the
                   first systematic study that resolves all major CMZ
                   clouds at interferometer angular resolution (i.e., a
                   few arc seconds). Here we present initial results
                   based on observations with the Submillimeter Array
                   (SMA) and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX).
                   Our study is complemented by dust emission data from
                   the Herschel Space Telescope and a comprehensive
                   literature survey of CMZ star formation activity. Our
                   research reveals (i) an unusually steep
                   linewidth-size relation, sigma(v) ∝
                   reff0.66$\pm$0.18, down to velocity dispersions 0.6
                   km s-1 at 0.1 pc scale. This scaling law potentially
                   results from the decay of gas motions to transonic
                   velocities in strong shocks. The data also show that,
                   relative to dense gas in the solar neighborhood, (ii)

                   molecular zone (CMZ; inner 200 pc) of the Milky Way.
                   This is made possible with data from the Galactic
                   Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS), which is the
                   first study resolving all major molecular clouds in
                   the CMZ at interferometer angular resolution. We find
                   that many CMZ molecular clouds have unusually shallow
                   density gradients compared to regions elsewhere in
                   the Milky Way. This is possibly a consequence of weak
                   gravitational binding of the clouds. The resulting
                   relative absence of dense gas on spatial scales 0.1
                   pc is probably one of the reasons why star formation
                   (SF) in dense gas of the CMZ is suppressed by a
                   factor 10, compared to solar neighborhood clouds.
                   Another factor suppressing star formation is the high
                   SF density threshold that likely results from the
                   observed gas kinematics. Further, it is possible but
                   not certain that the star formation activity and
                   cloud density structure evolve systematically as
                   clouds orbit the CMZ.},

                   cosmic ray ionization rate orders of magnitude higher
                   than the disc; akin to the environment found in
                   star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Previous
                   studies have shown that this region is forming stars
                   at a rate per unit mass of dense gas which is at
                   least an order of magnitude lower than in the disc,
                   potentially violating theoretical predictions. We
                   show that all observational star formation rate
                   diagnostics - both direct counting of young stellar
                   objects and integrated light measurements - are in
                   agreement within a factor two, hence the low star
                   formation rate (SFR) is not the result of the
                   systematic uncertainties that affect any one method.
                   As these methods trace the star formation over
                   different time-scales, from 0.1 to 5 Myr, we conclude
                   that the SFR has been constant to within a factor of
                   a few within this time period. We investigate the
                   progression of star formation within gravitationally
                   bound clouds on ~parsec scales and find 1-4 per cent
                   of the cloud masses are converted into stars per
                   free-fall time, consistent with a subset of the
                   considered 'volumetric' star formation models.
                   However, discriminating between these models is
                   obstructed by the current uncertainties on the input
                   observables and, most importantly and urgently, by
                   their dependence on ill-constrained free parameters.
                   The lack of empirical constraints on these parameters
                   therefore represents a key challenge in the further
                   verification or falsification of current star

                   regions in the Milky Way (MW) provide the ultimate
                   benchmark for studying star formation. The extent to
                   which the results of these Galaxy-based studies can
                   be extrapolated to extragalactic systems depends on
                   the overlap of the environmental conditions probed.
                   In this paper, we compare the properties of clouds
                   and star-forming regions in the MW with those in
                   nearby galaxies and in the high-redshift Universe. We
                   find that in terms of their baryonic composition,
                   kinematics and densities, the clouds in the solar
                   neighbourhood are similar to those in nearby
                   galaxies. The clouds and regions in the Central
                   Molecular Zone (CMZ, i.e. the inner 250 pc) of the MW
                   are indistinguishable from high-redshift clouds and
                   galaxies. The presently low star formation rate in
                   the CMZ therefore implies that either (1) its gas
                   represents the initial conditions for high-redshift
                   starbursts or (2) some yet unidentified process
                   consistently suppresses star formation over ≳ 108
                   yr time-scales. We conclude that the MW contains
                   large reservoirs of gas with properties directly
                   comparable to most of the known range of star
                   formation environments and is therefore an excellent
                   template for studying star formation across
                   cosmological time-scales.},

                   physical conditions like those in high-redshift
                   galaxies. Aims: We measure the temperature of the
                   dense gas in the central molecular zone (CMZ) and
                   examine what drives it. Methods: We mapped the inner
                   300 pc of the CMZ in the temperature-sensitive J =
                   3-2 para-formaldehyde (p - H2CO) transitions. We used
                   the 32,1-22,0/ 30,3-20,2 line ratio to determine the
                   gas temperature in n ~ 104-105 cm-3 gas. We have
                   produced temperature maps and cubes with 30'' and 1
                   km s-1 resolution and published all data in FITS
                   form. Results: Dense gas temperatures in the Galactic
                   center range from ~60 K to >100 K in selected
                   regions. The highest gas temperatures TG> 100 K are
                   observed around the Sgr B2 cores, in the extended Sgr
                   B2 cloud, the 20 km s-1 and 50 km s-1 clouds, and in
                   "The Brick" (G0.253+0.016). We infer an upper limit
                   on the cosmic ray ionization rate zetaCR< 10-14s-1.
                   Conclusions: The dense molecular gas temperature of
                   the region around our Galactic center is similar to
                   values found in the central regions of other
                   galaxies, in particular starburst systems. The gas
                   temperature is uniformly higher than the dust
                   temperature, confirming that dust is a coolant in the
                   dense gas. Turbulent heating can readily explain the
                   observed temperatures given the observed line widths.
                   Cosmic rays cannot explain the observed variation in
                   gas temperatures, so CMZ dense gas temperatures are
                   not dominated by cosmic ray heating. The gas
                   temperatures previously observed to be high in the
                   inner ~75 pc are confirmed to be high in the entire
                   CMZ. The data can be accessed from

                   maps of our targets. These transitions are sensitive
                   to gas with densities of 105 cm-3 and temperatures

                   are all higher (>40 K) than their dust temperatures (
                   25 K). Our targets have a complex velocity structure
                   that requires a careful disentanglement of the

                   interstellar medium (ISM) has been extensively
                   measured and analysed, in both the local ISM and in
                   nearby normal galaxies. Generally, a power law
                   describes the relationship well with an index ranging
                   from 0.2 to 0.6, and is now referred to as one of the
                   'Larson's Relationships'. The nature of turbulence
                   and star formation is considered to be intimately
                   related to these relationships, so evaluating the
                   sigma-R correlations in various environments is
                   important for developing a comprehensive
                   understanding of the ISM. We measure the
                   linewidth-size relationship in the Central Molecular
                   Zone (CMZ) of the Galactic Centre using spectral line
                   observations of the high-density tracers N2H+, HCN,
                   H13CN and HCO+. We construct dendrograms, which map
                   the hierarchical nature of the
                   position-position-velocity (PPV) data, and compute
                   the linewidths and sizes of the dendrogram-defined
                   structures. The dispersions range from ˜2 to 30 km
                   s-1 in structures spanning sizes 2-40 pc. By
                   performing Bayesian inference, we show that a power
                   law with exponent 0.3-1.1 can reasonably describe the
                   sigma-R trend. We demonstrate that the derived
                   sigma-R relationship is independent of the locations
                   in the PPV data set where sigma and R are measured.
                   The uniformity in the sigma-R relationship indicates
                   that turbulence in the CMZ is driven on the large
                   scales beyond ≳30 pc. We compare the CMZ sigma-R
                   relationship to that measured in the Galactic
                   molecular cloud Perseus. The exponents between the
                   two systems are similar, suggestive of a connection
                   between the turbulent properties within a cloud to
                   its ambient medium. Yet, the velocity dispersion in
                   the CMZ is systematically higher, resulting in a
                   scaling coefficient that is approximately five times
                   larger. The systematic enhancement of turbulent
                   velocities may be due to the combined effects of
                   increased star formation activity, larger densities

                   HNC, we investigate the kinematics of dense gas in
                   the central ˜250 pc of the Galaxy. We present SCOUSE
                   (Semi-automated multi-COmponent Universal
                   Spectral-line fitting Engine), a line-fitting
                   algorithm designed to analyse large volumes of
                   spectral line data efficiently and systematically.
                   Unlike techniques which do not account for complex
                   line profiles, SCOUSE accurately describes the {l, b,
                   vLSR} distribution of Central Molecular Zone (CMZ)
                   gas, which is asymmetric about Sgr A* in both
                   position and velocity. Velocity dispersions range
                   from 2.6 km s-1 < sigma < 53.1 km s-1. A median
                   dispersion of 9.8 km s-1, translates to a Mach
                   number, M_3D>=28. The gas is distributed throughout
                   several `streams', with projected lengths ˜100-250
                   pc. We link the streams to individual clouds and
                   sub-regions, including Sgr C, the 20 and 50 km s-1
                   clouds, the dust ridge, and Sgr B2. Shell-like
                   emission features can be explained by the projection
                   of independent molecular clouds in Sgr C and the
                   newly identified conical profile of Sgr B2 in {l, b,
                   vLSR} space. These features have previously invoked
                   supernova-driven shells and cloud-cloud collisions as
                   explanations. We instead caution against structure
                   identification in velocity-integrated emission maps.
                   Three geometries describing the 3D structure of the
                   CMZ are investigated: (i) two spiral arms; (ii) a
                   closed elliptical orbit; (iii) an open stream. While
                   two spiral arms and an open stream qualitatively
                   reproduce the gas distribution, the most recent
                   parametrization of the closed elliptical orbit does
                   not. Finally, we discuss how proper motion
                   measurements of masers can distinguish between these
                   geometries, and suggest that this effort should be
                   focused on the 20 km s-1 and 50 km s-1 clouds and Sgr

  abstract =      {We have used the Long Wavelength Spectrometer (LWS)
                   aboard the Infrared Space Observatory in grating mode
                   to map the far-infrared continuum emission (45-175
                   mic) toward several massive Giant Molecular Cloud
                   (GMC) cores located near the Galactic center. These
                   sources are observed in emission at far-infrared and
                   submillimeter wavelengths (>100 mic). However, at
                   mid-infrared wavelengths (<70 mic) they are seen in
                   absorption against the general Galactic centre
                   background. Gray-body fits to the observed
                   far-infrared and submillimeter spectral energy
                   distributions give low temperatures (about 13-20 K)
                   for the bulk of the dust in all the sources. This
                   indicates external heating of the dust by the diffuse
                   ISRF and suggests that the cores do not harbor
                   high-mass star-formation sites, in spite of their
                   large molecular mass. In addition, the grain
                   emissivity in these sources is a very steep function
                   of frequency (beta > 2.4). The high grain emissivity
                   exponent is consistent with the presence of dust
                   grains covered with thick ice mantles. Molecular line
                   observations carried out with the Caltech
                   Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) show a large velocity
                   gradient across the most massive core, GCM0.25+0.11,
                   indicative of streaming motions of the gas or of the
                   presence of multiple, spatially overlapping velocity
                   components. The observed gas kinematics may indicate
                   that the GCM0.25+0.11 core is in an early stage of a
                   cloud-cloud collision that may result in a future
                   star formation episode. Recent MSX observations
                   indicate that cold GMC cores similar to those studied
                   with ISO are ubiquitous in the Galactic center and
                   throughout the Galaxy. The observed intensities of
                   the OI and CII fine structure lines imply a radiation
                   field intensity of about 1000 times the standard ISRF
                   intensity and a hydrogen density of about 1000 pccm\

                   Galactic center are analyzed and compared to infrared
                   and radio continuum data. The BGPS 1.1 mm emission
                   consists of clumps interconnected by a network of
                   fainter filaments surrounding cavities, a few of
                   which are filled with diffuse near-IR emission
                   indicating the presence of warm dust or with radio
                   continuum characteristic of H II regions or supernova
                   remnants. New 350 mum images of the environments of
                   the two brightest regions, Sgr A and B, are
                   presented. Sgr B2 is the brightest
                   millimeter-emitting clump in the Central Molecular
                   Zone (CMZ) and may be forming the closest analog to a
                   super star cluster in the Galaxy. The CMZ contains
                   the highest concentration of millimeter- and
                   submillimeter-emitting dense clumps in the Galaxy.
                   Most 1.1 mm features at positive longitudes are seen
                   in silhouette against the 3.6-24 mum background
                   observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope. However,
                   only a few clumps at negative longitudes are seen in
                   absorption, confirming the hypothesis that positive
                   longitude clumps in the CMZ tend to be on the near
                   side of the Galactic center, consistent with the
                   suspected orientation of the central bar in our
                   Galaxy. Some 1.1 mm cloud surfaces are seen in
                   emission at 8 mum, presumably due to polycyclic
                   aromatic hydrocarbons. A ~0fdg2 (~30 pc) diameter
                   cavity and infrared bubble between l{\^a}‰ˆ 0fdg0
                   and 0fdg2 surround the Arches and Quintuplet clusters
                   and Sgr A. The bubble contains several clumpy dust
                   filaments that point toward Sgr A*; its potential
                   role in their formation is explored. Bania's Clump 2,
                   a feature near l = 3$\,^{\circ}$-3fdg5 which exhibits
                   extremely broad molecular emission lines (DeltaV> 150
                   km s-1), contains dozens of 1.1 mm clumps. These
                   clumps are deficient in near- and mid-infrared
                   emission in the Spitzer images when compared to both
                   the inner Galactic plane and the CMZ. Thus, Bania's
                   Clump 2 is either inefficient in forming stars or is
                   in a pre-stellar phase of clump evolution. The
                   Bolocat catalog of 1.1 mm clumps contains 1428
                   entries in the Galactic center between l = 358fdg5
                   and l = 4fdg5 of which about 80% are likely to be
                   within about 500 pc of the center. The mass spectrum
                   above about 80 M sun can be described by a power-law
                   DeltaN/DeltaM = N 0 M -2.14(+0.1,-0.4). The power-law
                   index is somewhat sensitive to systematic grain
                   temperature variations, may be highly biased by
                   source confusion, and is very sensitive to the
                   spatial filtering inherent in the data acquisition
                   and reduction.},

                   regard to gasdynamics and the formation of young
                   stellar objects (YSOs). We probe this possibility
                   with mid-infrared observations obtained with Infrared
                   Array Camera and Multiband Imaging Photometer on
                   Spitzer and with Midcourse Space Experiment. We use
                   color-color diagrams and spectral energy distribution
                   (SED) fits to explore the nature of YSO candidates
                   (including objects with 4.5 mum excesses possibly due
                   to molecular emission). There is an asymmetry in the
                   distribution of the candidate YSOs, which tend to be
                   found at negative Galactic longitudes; this behavior
                   contrasts with that of the molecular gas,
                   approximately 2/3 of which is at positive longitudes.
                   The small-scale height of these objects suggests that
                   they are within the Galactic center region and are
                   dynamically young. They lie between two layers of
                   infrared dark clouds and may have originated from
                   these clouds. We identify new sites for this recent
                   star formation by comparing the mid-IR, radio,
                   submillimeter, and methanol maser data. The methanol
                   masers appear to be associated with young, embedded
                   YSOs characterized by 4.5 mum excesses. We use the
                   SEDs of these sources to estimate their physical
                   characteristics; their masses appear to range from
                   ~10 to ~20 M sun. Within the central 400 × 50 pc
                   (|l| < 1fdg3 and |b| < 10') the star formation rate
                   (SFR) based on the identification of Stage I
                   evolutionary phase of YSO candidates is about 0.14 M

                   the population of YSOs are classified as Stage I
                   objects, we suggest that a recent burst of star
                   formation took place within the last 105 yr. This
                   suggestion is also consistent with estimates of SFRs
                   within the last ~107 yr showing a peak around 105 yr
                   ago. Lastly, we find that the Schmidt-Kennicutt Law
                   applies well in the central 400 pc of the Galaxy.
                   This implies that star formation does not appear to
                   be dramatically affected by the extreme physical
                   conditions in the Galactic center region.},

                   projected ~45 pc from the Galactic centre contains
                   ~105 M&sun; of dense gas whilst being mostly devoid
                   of observed star-formation tracers. Aims: Our goals
                   are therefore to scrutinise the physical properties,
                   dynamics and structure of this cloud with reference
                   to its star-forming potential. Methods: We have
                   carried out a concerted SMA and IRAM 30 m study of
                   this enigmatic cloud in dust continuum, CO
                   isotopologues, several shock tracing molecules, as
                   well as H2CO to trace the gas temperature. In
                   addition, we include ancillary far-IR and sub-mm
                   Herschel and SCUBA data in our analysis. Results: We
                   detect and characterise a total of 36 dust cores
                   within G0.253+0.016 at 1.3 mm and 1.37 mm, with
                   masses between 25 and approximately 250 M&sun;, and
                   find that the kinetic temperature of the gas traced
                   by H2CO ratios is >320 K on size-scales of ~0.15 pc.
                   Analysis of the position-velocity diagrams of our
                   observed lines shows broad linewidths and strong
                   shock emission in the south of the cloud, indicating
                   that G0.253+0.016 is colliding with another cloud at
                   vLSR ~ 70 km s-1. We confirm via an analysis of the
                   observed dynamics in the Central Molecular Zone that
                   it is an elongated structure, orientated with Sgr B2
                   closer to the Sun than Sgr A*, however our results
                   suggest that the actual geometry may be more complex
                   than an elliptical ring. We find that the column
                   density probability distribution function of
                   G0.253+0.016 derived from SMA and SCUBA dust
                   continuum emission is log-normal with no discernible
                   power-law tail, consistent with little star
                   formation, and that its width can be explained in the
                   framework of theory predicting the density structure
                   of clouds created by supersonic, magnetised
                   turbulence. We also present the Delta-variance
                   spectrum of this region, a proxy for the density
                   power spectrum of the cloud, and show it is
                   consistent with that expected for clouds with no
                   current star formation. Finally, we show that even
                   after determining a scaled column density threshold
                   for star formation by incorporating the effects of
                   the increased turbulence in the cloud, we would still
                   expect ten stars with masses >15 M&sun; to form in
                   G0.253+0.016. If these cannot be accounted for by new
                   radio continuum observations, then further physical
                   aspects may be important, such as the background
                   column density level, which would turn an absolute
                   column density threshold for star formation into a
                   critical over-density. Conclusions: We conclude that
                   G0.253+0.016 contains high-temperatures and
                   wide-spread shocks, displaying evidence of
                   interaction with a nearby cloud which we identify at
                   vLSR ~ 70 km s-1. Our analysis of the structure of
                   the cloud can be well-explained by theory of
                   magnetised turbulence, and is consistent with little
                   or no current star formation. Using G0.253+0.016 as a
                   test-bed of the conditions required for star
                   formation in a different physical environment to that
                   of nearby clouds, we also conclude that there is not
                   one column density threshold for star formation, but
                   instead this value is dependant on the local physical
                   conditions. FITS files of data corresponding to Figs.

  abstract =      {Despite their importance as stellar nurseries and the
                   building blocks of galaxies, very little is known
                   about the formation of the highest mass clusters. The
                   dense clump G0.253+0.016 represents an example of a
                   clump that may form an Arches-like, high-mass
                   cluster. Here we present molecular line maps toward
                   G0.253+0.016 taken as part of the MALT90 molecular
                   line survey, complemented with APEX observations.
                   Combined, these data reveal the global physical
                   properties and kinematics of G0.253+0.016. Recent
                   Herschel data show that while the dust temperature is
                   low (~19 K) toward its center, the dust temperature
                   on the exterior is higher (~27 K) due to external
                   heating. Our new molecular line data reveal that,
                   overall, the morphology of dense gas detected toward
                   G0.253+0.016 matches its IR extinction and dust
                   continuum emission very well. An anticorrelation
                   between the dust and gas column densities toward its
                   center indicates that the clump is centrally
                   condensed with a cold, dense interior in which the
                   molecular gas is chemically depleted. The velocity
                   field shows a strong gradient along the clump's major
                   axis, with the blueshifted side at a higher Galactic
                   longitude. The optically thick gas tracers are
                   systematically redshifted with respect to the
                   optically thin and hot gas tracers, indicating radial
                   motions. The gas kinematics and line ratios support
                   the recently proposed scenario in which G0.253+0.016
                   results from a tidal compression during a recent
                   pericenter passage near Sgr A*. Because G0.253+0.016
                   represents an excellent example of a clump that may
                   form a high-mass cluster, its detailed study should
                   reveal a wealth of knowledge about the early stages
                   of cluster formation.},

  abstract =      {G0.253+0.016 is a molecular clump that appears to be
                   on the verge of forming a high-mass cluster: its
                   extremely low dust temperature, high mass, and high
                   density, combined with its lack of prevalent star
                   formation, make it an excellent candidate for an
                   Arches-like cluster in a very early stage of
                   formation. Here we present new Atacama Large
                   Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array observations of its
                   small-scale (~0.07 pc) 3 mm dust continuum and
                   molecular line emission from 17 different species
                   that probe a range of distinct physical and chemical
                   conditions. The data reveal a complex network of
                   emission features with a complicated velocity
                   structure: there is emission on all spatial scales,
                   the morphology of which ranges from small, compact
                   regions to extended, filamentary structures that are
                   seen in both emission and absorption. The dust column
                   density is well traced by molecules with higher
                   excitation energies and critical densities,
                   consistent with a clump that has a denser interior. A
                   statistical analysis supports the idea that
                   turbulence shapes the observed gas structure within
                   G0.253+0.016. We find a clear break in the turbulent
                   power spectrum derived from the optically thin dust
                   continuum emission at a spatial scale of ~0.1 pc,
                   which may correspond to the spatial scale at which
                   gravity has overcome the thermal pressure. We suggest
                   that G0.253+0.016 is on the verge of forming a
                   cluster from hierarchical, filamentary structures
                   that arise from a highly turbulent medium. Although
                   the stellar distribution within high-mass Arches-like
                   clusters is compact, centrally condensed, and smooth,
                   the observed gas distribution within G0.253+0.016 is
                   extended, with no high-mass central concentration,
                   and has a complex, hierarchical structure. If this
                   clump gives rise to a high-mass cluster and its stars
                   are formed from this initially hierarchical gas
                   structure, then the resulting cluster must evolve
                   into a centrally condensed structure via a dynamical
                   process.},

                   an east-west direction whose driving source is
                   located at K2. In addition, the SO2 line core shows a
                   north-south velocity gradient most probably
                   indicating a hot core of molecular gas rotating

                   several previously known H II regions. Current models
                   of ultracompact H II regions are discussed within the
                   context of these new data. The images detail 49
                   individual continuum components within the Sgr B2
                   complex. Half of these have diameters less than 5000
                   AU, including several unresolved components
                   (diameters <2100 AU). These H II regions may be
                   explained by a disk photoevaporation model. There are
                   many asymmetrically bright shell-like and arclike H
                   II regions in Sgr B2. The asymmetries observed in the
                   1.3 cm continuum from these shell-like and arclike H
                   II regions correspond to gradients in the 20 cm -->
                   1.3 cm spectral indices, reflecting gradients in the
                   electron densities within many of these H II regions.
                   These shell- and arclike sources may be best

                   incorporating stellar winds and significant gradients
                   in the density of ambient neutral material. Numerous
                   filamentary structures are seen in images of the
                   long-tail cometary H II region Sgr B2 I. At least
                   three components are identified in the tail region

                   external winds which originate within the nearby Sgr
                   B2 F cluster of H II regions.},

                   embedded protostellar candidates in the 20 km s-1
                   cloud, one of the massive molecular clouds in the
                   Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way, using
                   interferometric submillimeter continuum and H2O maser
                   observations. The submillimeter continuum emission
                   shows five 1 pc scale clumps, each of which further
                   fragments into several 0.1 pc scale cores. We
                   identify 17 dense cores, among which 12 are
                   gravitationally bound. Among the 18 H2O masers
                   detected, 13 coincide with the cores and probably
                   trace outflows emanating from the protostars. There
                   are also 5 gravitationally bound dense cores without
                   H2O maser detection. In total, the 13 masers and 5
                   cores may represent 18 protostars with spectral types
                   later than B1 or potentially growing more massive
                   stars at earlier evolutionary stages, given the
                   non-detection in the centimeter radio continuum. In
                   combination with previous studies of CH3OH masers, we
                   conclude that the star formation in this cloud is at
                   an early evolutionary phase, before the presence of
                   any significant ionizing or heating sources. Our
                   findings indicate that star formation in this cloud
                   may be triggered by a tidal compression as it
                   approaches pericenter, similar to the case of
                   G0.253+0.016 but with a higher star formation rate,
                   and demonstrate that high angular resolution,
                   high-sensitivity maser, and submillimeter
                   observations are promising techniques to unveil
                   deeply embedded star formation in the CMZ.},

                   we report molecular line studies with high angular
                   resolution (˜3") of the environment of star
                   formation in this cloud. Maps of various molecular
                   line transitions as well as the continuum at 1.3 mm
                   are obtained using the Submillimeter Array. Five NH3
                   inversion lines and the 1.3 cm continuum are observed
                   with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The
                   interferometric observations are complemented with
                   single-dish data. We find that the CH3OH, SO, and
                   HNCO lines, which are usually shock tracers, are
                   better correlated spatially with the compact dust
                   emission from dense cores among the detected lines.
                   These lines also show enhancement in intensities with
                   respect to SiO intensities toward the compact dust
                   emission, suggesting the presence of slow shocks or
                   hot cores in these regions. We find gas temperatures
                   of ≳100 K at 0.1 pc scales based on RADEX modeling
                   of the H2CO and NH3 lines. Although no strong
                   correlations between temperatures and linewidths/H2O
                   maser luminosities are found, in
                   high-angular-resolution maps we note several
                   candidate shock-heated regions offset from any dense
                   cores, as well as signatures of localized heating by
                   protostars in several dense cores. Our findings
                   suggest that at 0.1 pc scales in this cloud star
                   formation and strong turbulence may together affect
                   the chemistry and temperature of the molecular gas.},

                   site of high mass star formation likely to be located
                   in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) near Sgr C.
                   Located on the outskirts of the massive evolved H II
                   region associated with Sgr C, the area is
                   characterized by an Extended Green Object (EGO)
                   measuring ~10'' in size (0.4 pc), whose observational
                   characteristics suggest the presence of an embedded
                   massive protostar driving an outflow. Our data
                   confirm that early-stage star formation is taking
                   place on the periphery of the Sgr C H II region, with
                   detections of two protostellar cores and several
                   knots of H2 and Brackett gamma emission alongside a
                   previously detected compact radio source. We

                   favorable for massive star formation to occur,
                   however, there is no evidence of star formation

                   remarkable non-star-forming clouds such as G0.253 in

                   eighth region to contain an H2CO maser detected in
                   the Galaxy. Cloud C is one of only two sites of

                   center ridge, affirming that H2CO masers are
                   exclusively associated with high-mass star formation.
                   This discovery led us to search for other masers,
                   among which we found new SiO vibrationally excited
                   masers, making this the fourth star-forming region in

                   also a known source of CH3OH Class-II and OH maser

                   to two SiO and six H2CO in the Galactic disk, while
                   there is a relative dearth of H2O and CH3OH Class-II
                   masers in the CMZ. SiO and H2CO masers may be
                   preferentially excited in the CMZ, perhaps because of
                   higher gas-phase abundances from grain destruction
                   and heating, or alternatively H2O and CH3OH maser
                   formation may be suppressed in the CMZ. In any case,
                   Cloud C is a new testing ground for understanding
                   maser excitation conditions. Appendices are available

  abstract =      {We present high-resolution (3") maps of the (3, 3)
                   and (4, 4) lines of NH3 toward the southern part of
                   the molecular envelope of the Sagittarius B2
                   star-forming region. These maps reveal, for the first
                   time, that the morphology of the hot gas in the Sgr
                   B2 envelope is dominated by at least six rings, two
                   arcs, and a filament. The sizes of the rings are
                   between 1 and 2.6 pc and their thicknesses between
                   0.2 and 0.4 pc. Most of the gas in the rings is warm,
                   with kinetic temperatures, Tk, of 40-70 K, although
                   some parts of the low-velocity rings reach
                   temperatures larger than 100 K. These hot rings and
                   arcs represent regions of enhanced H2 density and/or
                   enhanced NH3 abundance in the Sgr B2 envelope. Some
                   of the hot rings show radial velocity gradients,
                   which suggests that the rings and arcs correspond to
                   three-dimensional shells expanding at velocities of
                   ~6-10 km s-1. The walls of the hot shells are highly
                   clumped and contain unresolved condensations (<~1")
                   in the line maps. There are two kinds of unresolved
                   condensations: those appearing in the (3, 3) line
                   maps with only weak emission in the (4, 4) line and
                   those with rather strong emission in the (4, 4) line
                   compared with that of the (3, 3) line. For the first
                   kind, we identify six condensations in the NH3 (3, 3)
                   line maps that have brightness temperatures larger
                   than the kinetic temperatures. It is likely that
                   these are newly found NH3 masers. We also find that
                   other masers in the region such as class II CH3OH and
                   H2CO masers are very well correlated in velocity and
                   position with the hot shells. The large number of
                   masers observed in the hot shells can be explained as
                   a result of the combination of high abundance of
                   volatile molecules like NH3, CH3OH, and H2CO
                   (produced by hot temperature and/or shock chemistry)
                   and sufficient velocity coherence at the edges of the
                   expanding shells. For the second kind of
                   condensations, we have identified three compact
                   sources in the walls of the shells that are hot
                   (Tk>~300 K) and have high H2 densities (>~106-107
                   cm-3). These exhibit characteristics similar to those
                   of the hot cores associated with newly formed massive
                   stars. The inferred dust luminosity for the hot cores
                   is at least 105 Lsolar, similar to the Orion A hot
                   core. The high luminosity of the hot cores and the
                   lack of associated radio continuum emission indicates
                   that these are internally heated and very likely
                   associated with the dense circumstellar material
                   surrounding newly formed stars. The detection of hot
                   cores suggests that massive star formation is not
                   restricted to only Sgr B2N and Sgr B2M but is also
                   taking place in the envelope of Sgr B2. Very likely,
                   this star formation has been triggered by the
                   expanding bubbles that produce the shells seen in the
                   NH3 inversion lines. We discuss the possible origin
                   of these hot shells. We find that a wind-blown bubble
                   driven by typical Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars could
                   account for the kinetic energies and the momenta
                   observed in the hot NH3 shells. A cluster containing
                   massive evolved stars such as the Quintuplet could
                   easily explain the large concentration of hot shells,
                   the heating of the warm envelope, and the peculiar
                   chemistry observed in the envelope of Sgr B2. The
                   implication of these findings for the heating of
                   Galactic center molecular clouds is briefly
                   discussed.},

                   -40 to +120 km s-1 positions for 68 maser components
                   were determined in Sgr B2 Main, 79 in Sgr B2 North,
                   14 in Sgr B2 Mid-North, and 17 in Sgr B2 South, for a
                   total of 178 H2O maser positions in Sgr B2. The cross
                   calibration scheme of Reid & Menten was used. Using
                   this procedure, high dynamic range continuum images
                   were obtained with accurate registration
                   (sigma~0.01") of the continuum and maser positions. A
                   detailed comparison between H II components and maser
                   positions for both Sgr B2 and W49N is presented. In
                   Sgr B2 Main, the H2O masers are predominantly located
                   at the outside edge of the high-frequency continuum,
                   lending support to the proposal that entrainment by
                   stellar winds may play an important role in H2O maser
                   emission.},

                   masers at 6668 MHz using a seven-beam receiver on the
                   Parkes telescope. Here we present results from the
                   first part, which provides sensitive unbiased
                   coverage of a large region around the Galactic
                   Centre. Details are given for 183 methanol maser
                   sites in the longitude range 345$\,^{\circ}$ through
                   the Galactic Centre to 6$\,^{\circ}$. Within
                   6$\,^{\circ}$ of the Galactic Centre, we found 88
                   maser sites, of which more than half (48) are new
                   discoveries. The masers are confined to a narrow
                   Galactic latitude range, indicative of many sources
                   at the Galactic Centre distance and beyond, and
                   confined to a thin disc population; there is no
                   high-latitude population that might be ascribed to
                   the Galactic bulge. Within 2$\,^{\circ}$ of the
                   Galactic Centre the maser velocities all lie between
                   -60 and +77kms-1, a range much smaller than the
                   540kms-1 range observed in CO. Elsewhere, the maser
                   with highest positive velocity (+107kms-1) occurs,
                   surprisingly, near longitude 355$\,^{\circ}$ and is
                   probably attributable to the Galactic bar. The maser
                   with the most negative velocity (-127kms-1) is near
                   longitude 346$\,^{\circ}$, within the
                   longitude-velocity locus of the near side of the
                   `3-kpc arm'. It has the most extreme velocity of a
                   clear population of masers associated with the near
                   and far sides of the 3-kpc arm. Closer to the
                   Galactic Centre the maser space density is generally
                   low, except within 0.25 kpc of the Galactic Centre
                   itself, the `Galactic Centre zone', where it is 50
                   times higher, which is hinted at by the longitude
                   distribution, and confirmed by the unusual
                   velocities.},

                   with the 8-GHz bandwidth University of New South

                   showing that the large-scale distribution of all

                   bright dust cores, as well as for the complete mapped
                   region of the CMZ. We highlight the behaviour of the
                   bright HCN, HNC and HCO+ line emission, together with
                   that from the 13C isotopologues of these species, and
                   compare the behaviour with that found in
                   extragalactic sources where the emission is
                   unresolved spatially. We also find that the
                   isotopologue line ratios (e.g. HCO+/H13CO+) rise
                   significantly with increasing redshifted velocity in
                   some locations. Line luminosities are also calculated
                   and compared to that of CO, as well as to line
                   luminosities determined for external galaxies.},

                   and distance of our Galaxy's central supermassive
                   black hole, Sgr A*. These results stem from a new
                   analysis that more than doubles the time baseline for
                   astrometry of faint stars orbiting Sgr A*, combining
                   2 decades of speckle imaging and adaptive optics
                   data. Specifically, we improve our analysis of the
                   speckle images by using information about a star's
                   orbit from the deep adaptive optics data (2005-2013)
                   to inform the search for the star in the speckle
                   years (1995-2005). When this new analysis technique
                   is combined with the first complete re-reduction of
                   Keck Galactic Center speckle images using speckle

                   adaptive optics to estimate the orbits of S0-38 and
                   S0-2 and thereby improve our constraints of the mass

                   o as determined by the combined orbital fit of S0-2
                   and S0-38 are improved by a factor of 2 and 2.5,
                   respectively, compared to an orbital fit of S0-2
                   alone and a factor of ˜2.5 compared to previous
                   results from stellar orbits. This analysis also
                   limits the extended dark mass within 0.01 pc to less
                   than 0.13 × 106 M &sun; at 99.7% confidence, a

                   Legacy Survey, a Very Long Baseline Array key science
                   project, the European VLBI Network, and the Japanese
                   VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry project. These
                   measurements provide strong evidence for the
                   existence of spiral arms in the Milky Way, accurately
                   locating many arm segments and yielding spiral pitch
                   angles ranging from about 7$\,^{\circ}$ to
                   20$\,^{\circ}$. The widths of spiral arms increase
                   with distance from the Galactic center. Fitting
                   axially symmetric models of the Milky Way with the
                   three-dimensional position and velocity information
                   and conservative priors for the solar and average
                   source peculiar motions, we estimate the distance to
                   the Galactic center, R 0, to be 8.34 $\pm$ 0.16 kpc,
                   a circular rotation speed at the Sun, Theta0, to be
                   240 $\pm$ 8 km s-1, and a rotation curve that is
                   nearly flat (i.e., a slope of -0.2 $\pm$ 0.4 km s-1
                   kpc-1) between Galactocentric radii of ≈5 and 16
                   kpc. Assuming a "universal" spiral galaxy form for
                   the rotation curve, we estimate the thin disk scale
                   length to be 2.44 $\pm$ 0.16 kpc. With this large
                   data set, the parameters R 0 and Theta0 are no longer
                   highly correlated and are relatively insensitive to
                   different forms of the rotation curve. If one adopts
                   a theoretically motivated prior that high-mass star
                   forming regions are in nearly circular Galactic
                   orbits, we estimate a global solar motion component
                   in the direction of Galactic rotation, V &sun; = 14.6
                   $\pm$ 5.0 km s-1. While Theta0 and V &sun; are
                   significantly correlated, the sum of these parameters
                   is well constrained, Theta0 + V &sun; = 255.2 $\pm$
                   5.1 km s-1, as is the angular speed of the Sun in its
                   orbit about the Galactic center, (Theta0 + V &sun;)/R
                   0 = 30.57 $\pm$ 0.43 km s-1 kpc-1. These parameters
                   improve the accuracy of estimates of the
                   accelerations of the Sun and the Hulse-Taylor binary
                   pulsar in their Galactic orbits, significantly
                   reducing the uncertainty in tests of gravitational
                   radiation predicted by general relativity.},

                   combines the ideas used in the MS-CLEAN and MF-CLEAN
                   algorithms for multi-scale and multi-frequency
                   deconvolution respectively, and can be used in
                   conjunction with existing wide-field imaging
                   algorithms. We also discuss a simpler hybrid of
                   spectral-line and continuum imaging methods and point
                   out situations where it may suffice. Results: We show
                   via simulations and application to multi-frequency
                   VLA data and wideband EVLA data, that it is possible
                   to reconstruct both spatial and spectral structure of
                   compact and extended emission at the continuum
                   sensitivity level and at the angular resolution
                   allowed by the highest sampled frequency.},

  abstract =      {Context. The two hot molecular cores Sgr B2(M) and
                   Sgr B2(N), which are located at the center of the
                   giant molecular cloud complex Sagittarius B2, have
                   been the targets of numerous spectral line surveys,
                   revealing a rich and complex chemistry. Aims: We seek
                   to characterize the physical and chemical structure
                   of the two high-mass star-forming sites Sgr B2(M) and
                   Sgr B2(N) using high-angular resolution observations
                   at millimeter wavelengths, reaching spatial scales of
                   about 4000 au. Methods: We used the Atacama Large
                   Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to perform an
                   unbiased spectral line survey of both regions in the
                   ALMA band 6 with a frequency coverage from 211 GHz to
                   275 GHz. The achieved angular resolution is 0.̋4,
                   which probes spatial scales of about 4000 au, i.e.,
                   able to resolve different cores and fragments. In
                   order to determine the continuum emission in these
                   line-rich sources, we used a new statistical method,
                   STATCONT, which has been applied successfully to this
                   and other ALMA datasets and to synthetic
                   observations. Results: We detect 27 continuum sources
                   in Sgr B2(M) and 20 sources in Sgr B2(N). We study
                   the continuum emission variation across the ALMA band
                   6 (i.e., spectral index) and compare the ALMA 1.3 mm
                   continuum emission with previous SMA 345 GHz and VLA
                   40 GHz observations to study the nature of the
                   sources detected. The brightest sources are dominated
                   by (partially optically thick) dust emission, while
                   there is an important degree of contamination from
                   ionized gas free-free emission in weaker sources.
                   While the total mass in Sgr B2(M) is distributed in
                   many fragments, most of the mass in Sgr B2(N) arises
                   from a single object, with filamentary-like
                   structures converging toward the center. There seems
                   to be a lack of low-mass dense cores in both regions.
                   We determine H2 volume densities for the cores of
                   about 107-109 cm-3 (or 105-107 M&sun; pc-3), i.e.,
                   one to two orders of magnitude higher than the
                   stellar densities of super star clusters. We perform
                   a statistical study of the chemical content of the
                   identified sources. In general, Sgr B2(N) is
                   chemically richer than Sgr B2(M). The chemically
                   richest sources have about 100 lines per GHz and the
                   fraction of luminosity contained in spectral lines at
                   millimeter wavelengths with respect to the total
                   luminosity is about 20%-40%. There seems to be a
                   correlation between the chemical richness and the
                   mass of the fragments, where more massive clumps are
                   more chemically rich. Both Sgr B2(N) and Sgr B2(M)
                   harbor a cluster of hot molecular cores. We compare
                   the continuum images with predictions from a detailed
                   3D radiative transfer model that reproduces the
                   structure of Sgr B2 from 45 pc down to 100 au.
                   Conclusions: This ALMA dataset, together with other
                   ongoing observational projects in the range 5 GHz to
                   200 GHz, better constrain the 3D structure of Sgr B2
                   and allow us to understand its physical and chemical
                   structure. FITS files of the continuum images as well
                   as the spectral index are available at the CDS via

                   plane of the Milky Way in 5 bands. We outline our
                   data reduction strategy and present some science
                   highlights on the two observed 2{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}

                   approximately centered at l = 30{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}
                   and l = 59{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}. The two regions are
                   extremely rich in intense and highly structured
                   extended emission which shows a widespread
                   organization in filaments. Source SEDs can be built
                   for hundreds of objects in the two fields, and
                   physical parameters can be extracted, for a good
                   fraction of them where the distance could be
                   estimated. The compact sources (which we will call
                   cores' in the following) are found for the most part
                   to be associated with the filaments, and the
                   relationship to the local beam-averaged column
                   density of the filament itself shows that a core
                   seems to appear when a threshold around AV ~ 1 is
                   exceeded for the regions in the l =
                   59{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z} field; a AV value between 5
                   and 10 is found for the l = 30{\^A}¬{\^a}ˆ{\v z}
                   field, likely due to the relatively higher distances
                   of the sources. This outlines an exciting scenario
                   where diffuse clouds first collapse into filaments,
                   which later fragment to cores where the column
                   density has reached a critical level. In spite of
                   core L/M ratios being well in excess of a few for
                   many sources, we find core surface densities between
                   0.03 and 0.5 g cm-2. Our results are in good
                   agreement with recent MHD numerical simulations of
                   filaments forming from large-scale converging flows.

                   and Photometric Imaging Receiver instrument on the
                   Herschel Space Observatory. This includes the
                   equations describing the calibration scheme, a

                   calibration parameters (for converting from voltage
                   to flux density) for every bolometer in each array,
                   an analysis of the error budget in the flux

                   of the flux calibration on observations of primary
                   and secondary calibrators. The procedure for deriving
                   the flux calibration parameters is divided into two
                   parts. In the first part, we use observations of
                   astronomical sources in conjunction with the
                   operation of the photometer internal calibration
                   source to derive the unscaled derivatives of the flux
                   calibration curves. To scale the calibration curves
                   in Jy beam-1 V-1, we then use observations of Neptune
                   in which the beam of each bolometer is mapped using a
                   very fine scan pattern. The total instrumental
                   uncertainties in the flux calibration for most
                   individual bolometers is ˜0.5 per cent, although a
                   few bolometers have uncertainties of ˜1-5 per cent
                   because of issues with the Neptune observations.
                   Based on application of the flux calibration
                   parameters to Neptune observations performed using
                   typical scan map observing modes, we determined that
                   measurements from each array as a whole have
                   instrumental uncertainties of 1.5 per cent. This is
                   considerably less than the absolute calibration

                   of the Planck/HFI and Herschel/SPIRE instruments on
                   diffuse emission. The absolute calibration of HFI and
                   SPIRE each relies on planet flux measurements and
                   comparison with theoretical far-infrared emission
                   models of planetary atmospheres. We measure the
                   photometric cross calibration between the instruments
                   at two overlapping bands, 545 GHz/500 mum and 857
                   GHz/350 mum. The SPIRE maps used have been processed
                   in the Herschel Interactive Processing Environment
                   (Version 12) and the HFI data are from the 2015
                   Public Data Release 2. For our study we used 15 large
                   fields observed with SPIRE, which cover a total of
                   about 120 deg2. We have selected these fields
                   carefully to provide high signal-to-noise ratio,
                   avoid residual systematics in the SPIRE maps, and
                   span a wide range of surface brightness. The HFI maps
                   are bandpass-corrected to match the emission observed
                   by the SPIRE bandpasses. The SPIRE maps are convolved
                   to match the HFI beam and put on a common pixel grid.
                   We measure the cross-calibration relative gain
                   between the instruments using two methods in each
                   field, pixel-to-pixel correlation and angular power
                   spectrum measurements. The SPIRE/HFI relative gains
                   are 1.047 ($\pm$0.0069) and 1.003 ($\pm$0.0080) at
                   545 and 857 GHz, respectively, indicating very good
                   agreement between the instruments. These relative
                   gains deviate from unity by much less than the
                   uncertainty of the absolute extended emission
                   calibration, which is about 6.4% and 9.5% for HFI and
                   SPIRE, respectively, but the deviations are
                   comparable to the values 1.4% and 5.5% for HFI and
                   SPIRE if the uncertainty from models of the common
                   calibrator can be discounted. Of the 5.5% uncertainty
                   for SPIRE, 4% arises from the uncertainty of the
                   effective beam solid angle, which impacts the adopted
                   SPIRE point source to extended source unit conversion
                   factor, highlighting that as a focus for refinement.},

  abstract =      {Context. Despite their profound effect on the
                   universe, the formation of massive stars and stellar
                   clusters remains elusive. Recent advances in
                   observing facilities and computing power have brought
                   us closer to understanding this formation process. In
                   the past decade, compelling evidence has emerged that
                   suggests infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) may be
                   precursors to stellar clusters. However, the usual
                   method for identifying IRDCs is biased by the
                   requirement that they are seen in absorption against
                   background mid-IR emission, whereas dust continuum
                   observations allow cold, dense pre-stellar-clusters
                   to be identified anywhere. Aims: We aim to understand
                   what dust temperatures and column densities
                   characterize and distinguish IRDCs, to explore the
                   population of dust continuum sources that are not
                   IRDCs, and to roughly characterize the level of star
                   formation activity in these dust continuum sources.
                   Methods: We use Hi-GAL 70 to 500 mum data to identify
                   dust continuum sources in the l = 30$\,^{\circ}$ and
                   l = 59$\,^{\circ}$ Hi-GAL science demonstration phase
                   (SDP) fields, to characterize and subtract the
                   Galactic cirrus emission, and perform pixel-by-pixel
                   modified blackbody fits on cirrus-subtracted Hi-GAL
                   sources. We utilize archival Spitzer data to indicate
                   the level of star-forming activity in each pixel,
                   from mid-IR-dark to mid-IR-bright. Results: We
                   present temperature and column density maps in the
                   Hi-GAL l = 30$\,^{\circ}$ and l = 59$\,^{\circ}$ SDP
                   fields, as well as a robust algorithm for cirrus
                   subtraction and source identification using Hi-GAL
                   data. We report on the fraction of Hi-GAL source
                   pixels which are mid-IR-dark, mid-IR-neutral, or
                   mid-IR-bright in both fields. We find significant
                   trends in column density and temperature between
                   mid-IR-dark and mid-IR-bright pixels; mid-IR-dark
                   pixels are about 10 K colder and have a factor of 2
                   higher column density on average than mid-IR-bright
                   pixels. We find that Hi-GAL dust continuum sources
                   span a range of evolutionary states from pre- to
                   star-forming, and that warmer sources are associated
                   with more star formation tracers. Additionally, there
                   is a trend of increasing temperature with tracer type
                   from mid-IR-dark at the coldest, to outflow/maser
                   sources in the middle, and finally to 8 and 24 mum
                   bright sources at the warmest. Finally, we identify
                   five candidate IRDC-like sources on the far-side of
                   the Galaxy. These are cold (~20 K), high column
                   density (N(H2) > 1022 cm-2) clouds identified with
                   Hi-GAL which, despite bright surrounding mid-IR
                   emission, show little to no absorption at 8 mum.
                   These are the first inner Galaxy far-side candidate

                   temperature provides a lower limit to the electron
                   temperature. The H66-alpha recombination lines (nu =
                   22.4 GHz) in this region also suggest that the
                   temperature is high. The Local Thermodynamic
                   Equilibrium (LTE) electron temperature derived from
                   the H66-alpha data is 19,600 K. It is unclear what
                   the heating mechanism is, although a highly
                   nonequilibrium situation which occurs at the edge of
                   the expanding ionization front might be responsible.},

                   B2 Main [Sgr B2 (M)] has been observed with the Very
                   Large Array in the continuum (7 mm and 1.3 cm) and in
                   the radio recombination lines H52alpha, H66alpha, and
                   He 66alpha. The H66alpha(˜0".25 resolution) and
                   H52alpha(˜2".5 resolution) data provide high spatial
                   resolution kinematics of the ionized gas associated
                   with the massive stars. Both high spatial resolution
                   and sensitivity to large-scale structures are
                   essential to thoroughly sample the H II regions in
                   Sgr B2 (M) where source sizes of the 36 H II regions
                   range from unresolved (<0".3) to extended (˜10").
                   H66alpha recombination line emission has been
                   detected toward 23 of the 36 continuum sources in Sgr
                   B2 (M). The mean velocity of the detected sources is
                   62$\pm$2 km s-1. He 66alpha line emission is detected
                   toward nine of the 36 continuum sources. The 1.3 cm
                   helium and hydrogen data are used together as a
                   high-resolution probe of Y+ values and variations
                   within Sgr B2 (M). An average singly ionized helium
                   abundance of <Y+> = 10.3%$\pm$1.2% is derived. Of the
                   sources where a Y+ value is determined, only Sgr B2 F
                   has an anomalously low value (Y+ <= 5%). The
                   recombination line data are examined in detail toward
                   several of the most unusual sources. A very broad
                   radio recombination line (DeltaVH66alpha ˜ 64 km
                   s-1, DeltaVH52alpha ˜ 59 km s-1) is measured, and
                   high electron temperatures [Te(H66alpha)* = 26,400 K]
                   are derived for Sgr B2 F. The broad lines and high
                   temperatures may be due to a nonequilibrium
                   environment at the edge of an expanding H II region.
                   Assuming that the F and G H II regions have expanded
                   in a dense molecular environment, they appear to be
                   young, with an average age of <tau> = 0.7$\pm$0.3 x
                   104 yr. This lower limit on the age is consistent
                   with the dynamical age of the nearby massive
                   molecular outflow observed by Lis et al. A doubly
                   peaked H66alpha line has been detected toward the
                   ultracompact H II (UC HII) region Z10.24. This source
                   may be either a very young (tau < 100 yr) shell
                   source or the ionized base of a molecular outflow.
                   The small number of morphological cometary H II
                   regions in Sgr B2 (<5%) and the observed velocity
                   gradients in those regions that do have a cometary
                   morphology indicate that the moving star bow shock
                   model cannot account for any of the H II regions in
                   Sgr B2 (M).},

                   regions in the star-forming regions Sgr B2 Main and
                   North. To further study these variations, we have
                   made new 7 mm continuum and recombination line
                   observations of Sgr B2 at the highest possible
                   angular resolution of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
                   Array (VLA). We have observed Sgr B2 Main and North
                   at 42.9 GHz and at 45.4 GHz in the BnA configuration
                   (Main) and the A configuration (North). We compare
                   these new data to archival VLA 7 mm continuum data of
                   Sgr B2 Main observed in 2003 and Sgr B2 North
                   observed in 2001. We find that 1 of the 41 known
                   ultracompact and hypercompact H ii regions in Sgr B2
                   (K2-North) has decreased ~27% in flux density from
                   142 $\pm$ 14 to 103 $\pm$ 10 mJy (2.3sigma) between
                   2001 and 2012. A second source, F3c-Main, has
                   increased ~30% in flux density from 82 $\pm$ 8 to 107
                   $\pm$ 11 mJy (1.8sigma) between 2003 and 2012.
                   F3c-Main was previously observed to increase in flux
                   density at 1.3 cm over a longer time period between
                   1989 and 2012. An observation of decreasing flux
                   density, such as that observed in K2-North, is
                   particularly significant since such a change is not
                   predicted by the classical hypothesis of steady
                   expansion of H ii regions during massive star
                   accretion. Our new observations at 7 mm, along with
                   others in the literature, suggest that the formation
                   of massive stars occurs through time-variable and
                   violent accretion.},

                   temperature measured for this cloud (400 K) and can

                   masers are concentrated in the southernmost part of

                   a model for the stellar distribution, and find

                   emission that has been reported by other authors,
                   probably have their origin in the young stars that

                   different. Isotropic maser luminosities range between
                   1 × 10-6 and 2.1 × 10-5 L&sun;. In addition, 17
                   regions with broad line width quasi-thermal 44 GHz
                   CH3OH emission are identified, many of which are
                   close to known molecular hot cores, in particular
                   those associated with the Sgr B2(N) and Sgr B2(M)
                   continuum sources. In Sgr B2(N), quasi-thermal
                   emission appears to be associated with two 10"
                   diameter ionized shells. These ionized shells may
                   have swept up and shocked molecular material as they
                   expanded. Also, a quasi-thermal core is observed to
                   be coincident with a source of continuum emission
                   from dust and emission from more complex species. In
                   Sgr B2(M), CH3OH quasi-thermal emission arises
                   predominantly from the western portion of this
                   region. The CH3OH fractional abundance in most of the
                   quasi-thermal cores appears to be quite high at
                   ~10-6. It is argued that grain-surface chemistry is
                   responsible for this high abundance.},

                   candidate, G11.92-0.61-MM2, initially identified in
                   the course of studies of GLIMPSE Extended Green
                   Objects (EGOs). Separated by ~7.''2 from the nearby
                   MM1 protostellar hot core, MM2 is a strong, compact
                   dust continuum source (submillimeter spectral index
                   alpha = 2.6 $\pm$ 0.1), but is devoid of star
                   formation indicators. In contrast to MM1, MM2 has no
                   masers, no centimeter continuum, and no
                   (sub)millimeter wavelength line emission in ~24 GHz
                   of bandwidth observed with the SMA, including
                   N2H+(3-2), HCO+(3-2), and HCN(3-2). Additionally,
                   there is no evidence for an outflow driven by MM2.
                   The (sub)millimeter spectral energy distribution of
                   MM2 is best fit with a dust temperature of ~17-19 K
                   and luminosity of ~5-7 L &sun;. The combined physical
                   properties of MM2, as inferred from its dust
                   continuum emission, are extreme: M >~ 30 M &sun;
                   within a radius <1000 AU, N_H_2>1025 cm-2 and n_H_2
                   >109 cm-3. Comparison of the molecular abundance
                   limits derived from our SMA observations with
                   gas-grain chemical models indicates that extremely
                   dense (n(H) Gt 108 cm-3), cold (<20 K) conditions are

                   (sub)millimeter line emission, consistent with the
                   dust continuum results. Our data suggest that
                   G11.92-0.61-MM2 is the best candidate for a bonafide
                   massive prestellar core found to date, and a

                   Galaxy form in regions of very high surface density,
                   Sigma~1 g cm-2. Clusters containing massive stars and
                   globular clusters have a column density comparable to
                   this. The total pressure in clouds of such a column
                   density is P/k~108-109 K cm-3, far greater than that
                   in the diffuse interstellar medium or the average in
                   giant molecular clouds. Observations show that
                   massive-star-forming regions are supersonically
                   turbulent, and we show that the molecular cores out
                   of which individual massive stars form are as well.
                   The protostellar accretion rate in such a core is
                   approximately equal to the instantaneous mass of the
                   star divided by the free-fall time of the gas that is
                   accreting onto the star, as described by Stahler,
                   Shu, & Taam. The star formation time in this
                   turbulent core model for massive-star formation is
                   several times the mean free-fall time of the core out
                   of which the star forms but is about equal to that of
                   the region in which the core is embedded. The high
                   densities in regions of massive-star formation lead
                   to typical timescales for the formation of a massive
                   star of about 105 yr. The corresponding accretion
                   rate is high enough to overcome the radiation
                   pressure due to the luminosity of the star. For the
                   typical case we consider, in which the cores out of
                   which the stars form have a density structure
                   rho~r-1.5, the protostellar accretion rate grows with
                   time as m*~t. We present a new calculation of the
                   evolution of the radius of a protostar and determine
                   the protostellar accretion luminosity. At the high
                   accretion rates that are typical in regions of
                   massive-star formation, protostars join the main
                   sequence at about 20 Msolar. We apply these results
                   to predict the properties of protostars thought to be
                   powering several observed hot molecular cores,
                   including the Orion hot core and W3(H2O). In the
                   appendices we discuss the pressure in molecular
                   clouds and argue that ``logatropic'' models for
                   molecular clouds are incompatible with observation.},

                   nonthermal radio filaments (NRFs). The linear
                   filaments are not isolated but are generally
                   clustered in star-forming regions where prominent
                   NRFs had been detected previously. The extensions of
                   many of these linear filaments appear to terminate at
                   either a compact source or a resolved shell-like
                   thermal source. A relationship between the filaments,
                   the compact and extended thermal sources, as well as
                   a lack of preferred orientation for many RFs should
                   constrain models that are proposed to explain the
                   origin of nonthermal radio filaments in the Galactic

                   atmosphere models applied to a sample of hot stars,
                   we construct calibrations of effective temperature
                   (Teff), and gravity (log g) with a spectral type and
                   luminosity class for Galactic O-type and early B-type
                   stars. From the model results we also derive an
                   empirical relation between the bolometric correction
                   and Teff and log g. Using a sample of stars with
                   known distances located in OB associations in the
                   Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud, we derive a
                   new calibration of Mupsilo with spectral class. With
                   these new calibrations and the stellar atmosphere
                   models of Kurucz, we calculate the physical
                   parameters and ionizing photon luminosities in the H0
                   and He0 continua for O and early B-type stars. We
                   find substantial differences between our values of
                   the Lyman- continuum luminosity and those reported in
                   the literature. We also discuss the systematic
                   discrepancy between O-type stellar masses derived
                   from spectroscopic models and those derived from
                   evolutionary tracks. Most likely, the cause of this
                   "mass discrepancy" lies primarily in the atmospheric
                   models, which are plane parallel and hydrostatic and
                   therefore do not account for an extended atmosphere
                   and the velocity fields in a stellar wind. Finally,
                   we present a new computation of the Lyman-continuum
                   luminosity from 429 known O stars located within 2.5
                   kpc of the Sun. We find the total ionizing luminosity

                   To check the consistency of spectral types from the
                   literature, we estimate new spectral types for 52
                   nearby pre-MS stars with spectral types F3 through M4
                   using optical spectra taken with the SMARTS 1.5 m
                   telescope. Combining these new types with published
                   spectral types and photometry from the literature
                   (Johnson-Cousins BVIC , 2MASS JHKS and WISE W1, W2,
                   W3, and W4), we derive a new empirical spectral
                   type-color sequence for 5-30 Myr old pre-MS stars.
                   Colors for pre-MS stars match dwarf colors for some
                   spectral types and colors, but for other spectral
                   types and colors, deviations can exceed 0.3 mag. We
                   estimate effective temperatures (T eff) and
                   bolometric corrections (BCs) for our pre-MS star
                   sample through comparing their photometry to
                   synthetic photometry generated using the BT-Settl
                   grid of model atmosphere spectra. We derive a new T
                   eff and BC scale for pre-MS stars, which should be a
                   more appropriate match for T Tauri stars than
                   often-adopted dwarf star scales. While our new T eff
                   scale for pre-MS stars is within sime100 K of dwarfs
                   at a given spectral type for stars <G5, for G5
                   through K6, the pre-MS stars are ~250 K cooler than
                   their MS counterparts. Lastly, we present (1) a

                   O9V-M9V MS stars based on an extensive literature

                   desorption, as well as gas-phase interactions. We
                   have included three mechanisms to remove species from
                   the grain mantles: thermal evaporation,
                   cosmic-ray-induced heating, and photodesorption. A
                   wide range of parameter space has been explored to
                   examine the abundance of species present both on the
                   grain mantles and in the gas phase as a function of
                   both position in the cloud (visual extinction) and of
                   evolutionary state (time). The dominant mechanism
                   that removes molecules from the grain mantles is
                   cosmic-ray desorption. At times greater than the
                   depletion timescale, the abundances of some simple
                   species agree with abundances observed in the cold
                   dark cloud TMC-1. Even though cosmic-ray desorption
                   preserves the gas-phase chemistry at late times,
                   molecules do show significant depletions from the gas
                   phase. Examination of the dependence of depletion as
                   a function of density shows that when the density
                   increases from 103/cc to 105/cc several species
                   including HCO(+), HCN, and CN show gas-phase
                   abundance reductions of over an order of magnitude.
                   The CO: H2O ratio in the grain mantles for our
                   standard model is on the order of 10:1, in reasonable
                   agreement with observations of nonpolar CO ice
                   features in rho Ophiuchus and Serpens. We have also
                   examined the interdependence of CO depletion with the
                   space density of molecular hydrogen and binding
                   energy to the grain surface. We find that the
                   observed depletion of CO in Taurus in inconsistent
                   with CO bonding in an H2O rich mantle, in agreement
                   with observations. We suggest that if interstellar
                   grains consist of an outer layer of CO ice, then the
                   binding energies for many species to the grain mantle
                   may be lower than commonly used, and a significant
                   portion of molecular material may be maintained in
                   the gas phase.},

                   improvements on the previous generation of published
                   models: in particular, the new models cover a much
                   wider and more uniform region of parameter space, do
                   not include highly model-dependent parameters, and
                   include a number of improvements that make them more
                   suited to modeling far-infrared and sub-mm

                   part of a single monolithic set of models, the new

                   The aim of the new set of models is not to provide
                   the most physically realistic models for young stars,
                   but rather to provide deliberately simplified models
                   for initial modeling, which allows a wide range of

                   systems. Here, we study the role of pressure,

                   Taurus, to intermediate pressures of cluster-forming
                   clumps like the Orion Nebula Cluster, to very high
                   pressures that may be found in the densest infrared

                   stars during their formation process may have an
                   impact on their further evolution. Aims: In the
                   framework of the cold disc accretion scenario, we
                   study how angular momentum builds up inside the star
                   during its formation for the first time and what the
                   consequences are for its evolution on the main
                   sequence (MS). Methods: Computation begins from a
                   hydrostatic core on the Hayashi line of 0.7 M&sun; at
                   solar metallicity (Z = 0.014) rotating as a solid
                   body. Accretion rates depending on the luminosity of
                   the accreting object are considered, which vary
                   between 1.5 × 10-5 and 1.7 × 10-3 M&sun; yr-1. The
                   accreted matter is assumed to have an angular
                   velocity equal to that of the outer layer of the
                   accreting star. Models are computed for a mass-range
                   on the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) between 2 and 22
                   M&sun;. Results: We study how the internal and
                   surface velocities vary as a function of time during
                   the accretion phase and the evolution towards the
                   ZAMS. Stellar models, whose evolution has been
                   followed along the pre-MS phase, are found to exhibit
                   a shallow gradient of angular velocity on the ZAMS.
                   Typically, the 6 M&sun; model has a core that rotates
                   50% faster than the surface on the ZAMS. The degree
                   of differential rotation on the ZAMS decreases when
                   the mass increases (for a fixed value of
                   vZAMS/vcrit). The MS evolution of our models with a
                   pre-MS accreting phase show no significant
                   differences with respect to those of corresponding
                   models computed from the ZAMS with an initial
                   solid-body rotation. Interestingly, there exists a
                   maximum surface velocity that can be reached through
                   the present scenario of formation for masses on the
                   ZAMS larger than 8 M&sun;. Typically, only stars with
                   surface velocities on the ZAMS lower than about 45%

                   Protostar Survey: spectral energy distributions
                   (SEDs) and model fits of 330 young stellar objects,
                   predominantly protostars, in the Orion molecular
                   clouds. This is the largest sample of protostars
                   studied in a single, nearby star formation complex.
                   With near-infrared photometry from 2MASS, mid- and
                   far-infrared data from Spitzer and Herschel, and
                   submillimeter photometry from APEX, our SEDs cover
                   1.2-870 mum and sample the peak of the protostellar
                   envelope emission at ˜100 mum. Using mid-IR spectral
                   indices and bolometric temperatures, we classify our
                   sample into 92 Class 0 protostars, 125 Class I
                   protostars, 102 flat-spectrum sources, and 11 Class
                   II pre-main-sequence stars. We implement a simple
                   protostellar model (including a disk in an infalling
                   envelope with outflow cavities) to generate a grid of
                   30,400 model SEDs and use it to determine the
                   best-fit model parameters for each protostar. We
                   argue that far-IR data are essential for accurate
                   constraints on protostellar envelope properties. We
                   find that most protostars, and in particular the
                   flat-spectrum sources, are well fit. The median
                   envelope density and median inclination angle
                   decrease from Class 0 to Class I to flat-spectrum
                   protostars, despite the broad range in best-fit
                   parameters in each of the three categories. We also
                   discuss degeneracies in our model parameters. Our
                   results confirm that the different protostellar
                   classes generally correspond to an evolutionary
                   sequence with a decreasing envelope infall rate, but
                   the inclination angle also plays a role in the
                   appearance, and thus interpretation, of the SEDs.},

                   the Trapezium stars, normally seen at lower

                   telescope. This map has 15'' resolution. By combining

  abstract =      {The 229 GHz (lambda1.3 mm) radio emission from
                   Orion-KL was mapped with up to 0.''14 angular
                   resolution with CARMA, allowing measurements of the
                   flux densities of Source I ("SrcI") and the
                   Becklin-Neugebauer Object (BN), the two most massive
                   stars in this region. We find integrated flux
                   densities of 310 $\pm$ 45 mJy for SrcI and 240 $\pm$
                   35 mJy for BN. SrcI is optically thick even at 229
                   GHz. No trace of the H30alpha recombination line is
                   seen in its spectrum, although the v 2 = 1,
                   5(5,0)-6(4,3) transition of H2O, 3450 K above the
                   ground state, is prominent. SrcI is elongated at
                   position angle 140$\,^{\circ}$, as in 43 GHz images.
                   These results are most easily reconciled with models
                   in which the radio emission from SrcI arises via the
                   H- free-free opacity in a T < 4500 K disk, as
                   considered by Reid et al. By contrast, the radio
                   spectrum of BN is consistent with p +/e - free-free
                   emission from a dense (ne ~ 5 × 107 cm-3), but
                   otherwise conventional, hypercompact H II region. The
                   source is becoming optically thin at 229 GHz, and the
                   H30alpha recombination line, at V LSR = 23.2 $\pm$
                   0.5 km s-1, is prominent in its spectrum. A Lyman
                   continuum flux of 5 × 1045 photons s-1, consistent
                   with that expected from a B star, is required to
                   maintain the ionization. Supplementary 90 GHz
                   observations were made to measure the H41alpha and
                   H42alpha recombination lines toward BN. Published 43
                   and 86 GHz data suggest that SrcI brightened with
                   respect to BN over the 15 year period from 1994 to
                   2009.},

                   with long-wavelength observations at 2 mm and fit the
                   spectral energy distributions across a ~=2 pc long,
                   continuous section of OMC 2/3 at 15 000 AU (0.08 pc)

                   reconstructed simultaneously the filtered-out
                   large-scale emission at 2 mm. We implemented both
                   variable and fixed values of beta, finding that beta
                   = 1.7-1.8 provides the best fit across most of OMC

                   Thus, we show that beta values derived from spatial
                   filtered emission maps agree well with those values
                   from unfiltered data at the same resolution. Our
                   results contradict the very low beta values (~0.9)
                   previously measured in OMC 2/3 between 1.2 mm and 3.3
                   mm data, which we attribute to elevated fluxes in the

                   would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In
                   this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is
                   defined, stressing that there is evidence for a
                   change in the power-law index at only two masses:
                   near 0.5Msolar and near 0.08Msolar. Using this
                   supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in
                   any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated
                   by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise
                   and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is
                   found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite
                   well the observed scatter in power-law index
                   determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit
                   within which any true variation becomes undetectable.
                   The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that
                   any true variation of the IMF in well-studied
                   populations must be smaller than this scatter.
                   Determinations of the power-law indices alpha are
                   subject to systematic errors arising mostly from
                   unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is
                   quantified here, with the result that the single-star
                   IMFs for young star clusters are systematically
                   steeper by Deltaalpha~0.5 between 0.1 and 1Msolar
                   than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by,
                   on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in
                   globular clusters appear to be, on average,
                   systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF
                   (Piotto & Zoccali; Paresce & De Marchi), and the
                   recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in
                   the Galactic halo and the absence of associated
                   low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M{\'e}ndez & Minniti)
                   suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient
                   population. Star formation in higher metallicity
                   environments thus appears to produce relatively more
                   low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an
                   interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic
                   variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical
                   arguments.},

  abstract =      {We recently proposed that the star-forming potential
                   of dense molecular clouds in the Central Molecular
                   Zone (CMZ, i.e. the central few 100 pc) of the Milky
                   Way is intimately linked to their orbital dynamics,
                   potentially giving rise to an absolute-time sequence
                   of star-forming clouds. In this paper, we present an
                   orbital model for the gas stream(s) observed in the
                   CMZ. The model is obtained by integrating orbits in
                   the empirically constrained gravitational potential
                   and represents a good fit (chi _red^2=2.0) to the
                   observed position-velocity distribution of dense (n >
                   several 103 cm-3) gas, reproducing all of its key
                   properties. The orbit is also consistent with
                   observational constraints not included in the fitting
                   process, such as the 3D space velocities of Sgr B2
                   and the Arches and Quintuplet clusters. It differs
                   from previous, parametric models in several respects:
                   (1) the orbit is open rather than closed due to the
                   extended mass distribution in the CMZ, (2) its
                   orbital velocity (100-200 km s-1) is twice as high as
                   in previous models, and (3) Sgr A* coincides with the
                   focus of the (eccentric) orbit rather than being
                   offset. Our orbital solution supports the recently
                   proposed scenario in which the dust ridge between
                   G0.253+0.016 (`the Brick') and Sgr B2 represents an
                   absolute-time sequence of star-forming clouds, of
                   which the condensation was triggered by the tidal
                   compression during their most recent pericentre
                   passage. We position the clouds on a common timeline
                   and find that their pericentre passages occurred
                   0.30-0.74 Myr ago. Given their short free-fall times
                   (tff ˜ 0.34 Myr), the quiescent cloud G0.253+0.016
                   and the vigorously star-forming complex Sgr B2 are
                   separated by a single free-fall time of evolution,
                   implying that star formation proceeds rapidly once
                   collapse has been initiated. We provide the complete
                   orbital solution, as well as several quantitative
                   predictions of our model (e.g. proper motions and the
                   positions of star formation `hotspots'). The paper is
                   concluded with a discussion of the assumptions and
                   possible caveats, as well as the position of the
                   model in the Galactic context, highlighting its
                   relation to large-scale gas accretion, the dynamics
                   of the bar, the x2 orbital family, and the origin of
                   the Arches and Quintuplet clusters.},

                   so quickly that they are themselves gravitationally

                   density perturbations interact with young massive
                   stars, emitting ionizing radiation, alternately
                   exposing and confining their H II regions. As a
                   result, the H II regions are predicted to flicker in
                   flux density over periods of decades to centuries
                   rather than increase monotonically in size as
                   predicted by simple Spitzer solutions. We have
                   recently observed the Sgr B2 region at 1.3 cm with
                   the Very Large Array in its three hybrid
                   configurations (DnC, CnB, and BnA) at a resolution of
                   ~0.''25. These observations were made to compare in
                   detail with matched continuum observations from 1989.
                   At 0.''25 resolution, Sgr B2 contains 41 ultracompact
                   (UC) H II regions, 6 of which are hypercompact. The
                   new observations of Sgr B2 allow comparison of
                   relative peak flux densities for the H II regions in
                   Sgr B2 over a 23 year time baseline (1989-2012) in
                   one of the most source-rich massive star forming
                   regions in the Milky Way. The new 1.3 cm continuum
                   images indicate that four of the 41 UC H II regions
                   exhibit significant changes in their peak flux
                   density, with one source (K3) dropping in peak flux
                   density, and the other three sources (F10.303, F1,
                   and F3) increasing in peak flux density. The results
                   are consistent with statistical predictions from
                   simulations of high mass star formation, suggesting
                   that they offer a solution to the lifetime problem

                   photometry with both IRAC and MIPS instruments for
                   five large, nearby molecular clouds. Three of the
                   clouds were also mapped in dust continuum emission at
                   1.1 mm, and optical spectroscopy has been obtained
                   for some clouds. This paper combines information
                   drawn from studies of individual clouds into a
                   combined and updated statistical analysis of
                   star-formation rates and efficiencies, numbers and
                   lifetimes for spectral energy distribution (SED)
                   classes, and clustering properties. Current
                   star-formation efficiencies range from 3% to 6%; if
                   star formation continues at current rates for 10 Myr,
                   efficiencies could reach 15-30%. Star-formation rates
                   and rates per unit area vary from cloud to cloud;
                   taken together, the five clouds are producing about
                   260 M sun of stars per Myr. The star-formation
                   surface density is more than an order of magnitude
                   larger than would be predicted from the Kennicutt
                   relation used in extragalactic studies, reflecting
                   the fact that those relations apply to larger scales,
                   where more diffuse matter is included in the gas
                   surface density. Measured against the dense gas
                   probed by the maps of dust continuum emission, the
                   efficiencies are much higher, with stellar masses
                   similar to masses of dense gas, and the current stock
                   of dense cores would be exhausted in 1.8 Myr on
                   average. Nonetheless, star formation is still slow
                   compared to that expected in a free-fall time, even
                   in the dense cores. The derived lifetime for the
                   Class I phase is 0.54 Myr, considerably longer than
                   some estimates. Similarly, the lifetime for the Class
                   0 SED class, 0.16 Myr, with the notable exception of
                   the Ophiuchus cloud, is longer than early estimates.
                   If photometry is corrected for estimated extinction
                   before calculating class indicators, the lifetimes
                   drop to 0.44 Myr for Class I and to 0.10 for Class 0.
                   These lifetimes assume a continuous flow through the
                   Class II phase and should be considered median
                   lifetimes or half-lives. Star formation is highly
                   concentrated to regions of high extinction, and the
                   youngest objects are very strongly associated with
                   dense cores. The great majority (90%) of young stars
                   lie within loose clusters with at least 35 members
                   and a stellar density of 1 M sun pc-3. Accretion at
                   the sound speed from an isothermal sphere over the
                   lifetime derived for the Class I phase could build a
                   star of about 0.25 M sun, given an efficiency of 0.3.
                   Building larger mass stars by using higher mass
                   accretion rates could be problematic, as our data
                   confirm and aggravate the "luminosity problem" for
                   protostars. At a given T bol, the values for L bol
                   are mostly less than predicted by standard infall
                   models and scatter over several orders of magnitude.
                   These results strongly suggest that accretion is time
                   variable, with prolonged periods of very low
                   accretion. Based on a very simple model and this
                   sample of sources, half the mass of a star would be
                   accreted during only 7% of the Class I lifetime, as
                   represented by the eight most luminous objects.},

                   formation activity within nearby molecular clouds. We
                   employ a uniform set of infrared extinction maps to
                   provide accurate assessments of cloud mass and
                   structure and compare these with inventories of young
                   stellar objects within the clouds. We present
                   evidence indicating that both the yield and rate of
                   star formation can vary considerably in local clouds,
                   independent of their mass and size. We find that the
                   surface density structure of such clouds appears to
                   be important in controlling both these factors. In
                   particular, we find that the star formation rate
                   (SFR) in molecular clouds is linearly proportional to
                   the cloud mass (M 0.8) above an extinction threshold
                   of A K ≈ 0.8 mag, corresponding to a gas surface
                   density threshold of Sigmagas ≈ 116 M sun pc2. We
                   argue that this surface density threshold corresponds
                   to a gas volume density threshold which we estimate
                   to be n(H2) ≈ 104 cm-3. Specifically, we find SFR
                   (M sun yr-1) = 4.6 $\pm$ 2.6 × 10-8 M 0.8 (M sun)
                   for the clouds in our sample. This relation between
                   the rate of star formation and the amount of dense
                   gas in molecular clouds appears to be in excellent
                   agreement with previous observations of both galactic
                   and extragalactic star-forming activity. It is likely
                   the underlying physical relationship or empirical law
                   that most directly connects star formation activity
                   with interstellar gas over many spatial scales within
                   and between individual galaxies. These results
                   suggest that the key to obtaining a predictive
                   understanding of the SFRs in molecular clouds and
                   galaxies is to understand those physical factors
                   which give rise to the dense components of these
                   clouds.},

                   star-forming regions using a sample of young stellar
                   objects (YSOs) and massive dense clumps. Our YSO
                   sample consists of objects located in 20 large
                   molecular clouds from the Spitzer cores to disks
                   (c2d) and Gould's Belt (GB) surveys. These data allow
                   us to probe the regime of low-mass star formation,
                   essentially invisible to tracers of high-mass star
                   formation used to establish extragalactic SFR-gas
                   relations. We estimate the gas surface density
                   (Sigmagas) from extinction (AV ) maps and YSO SFR
                   surface densities (SigmaSFR) from the number of YSOs,
                   assuming a mean mass and lifetime. We also divide the
                   clouds into evenly spaced contour levels of AV ,
                   counting only Class I and Flat spectral energy
                   distribution YSOs, which have not yet migrated from
                   their birthplace. For a sample of massive
                   star-forming clumps, we derive SFRs from the total
                   infrared luminosity and use HCN gas maps to estimate
                   gas surface densities. We find that c2d and GB clouds
                   lie above the extragalactic SFR-gas relations (e.g.,
                   Kennicutt-Schmidt law) by factors of up to 17. Cloud
                   regions with high Sigmagas lie above extragalactic
                   relations up to a factor of 54 and overlap with
                   high-mass star-forming regions. We use 12CO and 13CO
                   gas maps of the Perseus and Ophiuchus clouds from the
                   COMPLETE survey to estimate gas surface densities and
                   compare to measurements from AV maps. We find that
                   13CO, with the standard conversions to total gas,
                   underestimates the AV -based mass by factors of ~4-5.
                   12CO may underestimate the total gas mass at Sigmagas
                   >~ 200 M sun pc-2 by gsim30%; however, this small
                   difference in mass estimates does not explain the
                   large discrepancy between Galactic and extragalactic
                   relations. We find evidence for a threshold of star
                   formation (Sigmath) at 129 $\pm$ 14 M sun pc-2. At
                   Sigmagas>Sigmath, the Galactic SFR-gas relation is
                   linear. A possible reason for the difference between
                   Galactic and extragalactic relations is that much of
                   Sigmagas is below Sigmath in extragalactic studies,
                   which detect all the CO-emitting gas. If the
                   Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (SigmaSFR vprop Sigma1.4
                   gas) and a linear relation between dense gas and star
                   formation are assumed, the fraction of dense
                   star-forming gas (f dense) increases as ~Sigma0.4
                   gas. When Sigmagas reaches ~300 Sigmath, the fraction
                   of dense gas is ~1, creating a maximal starburst.},

  abstract =      {The star formation rate (SFR) in the Central
                   Molecular Zone (CMZ, i.e. the central 500 pc) of the
                   Milky Way is lower by a factor of >=10 than expected
                   for the substantial amount of dense gas it contains,
                   which challenges current star formation theories. In
                   this paper, we quantify which physical mechanisms
                   could be responsible. On scales larger than the disc
                   scaleheight, the low SFR is found to be consistent
                   with episodic star formation due to secular
                   instabilities or possibly variations of the gas
                   inflow along the Galactic bar. The CMZ is marginally
                   Toomre-stable when including gas and stars, but
                   highly Toomre-stable when only accounting for the
                   gas, indicating a low condensation rate of
                   self-gravitating clouds. On small scales, we find
                   that the SFR in the CMZ may be caused by an elevated
                   critical density for star formation due to the high
                   turbulent pressure. The existence of a universal
                   density threshold for star formation is ruled out.
                   The H I-H2 phase transition of hydrogen, the tidal
                   field, a possible underproduction of massive stars
                   due to a bottom-heavy initial mass function, magnetic
                   fields, and cosmic ray or radiation pressure feedback
                   also cannot individually explain the low SFR. We
                   propose a self-consistent cycle of star formation in
                   the CMZ, in which the effects of several different
                   processes combine to inhibit star formation. The
                   rate-limiting factor is the slow evolution of the gas
                   towards collapse - once star formation is initiated
                   it proceeds at a normal rate. The ubiquity of star
                   formation inhibitors suggests that a lowered central
                   SFR should be a common phenomenon in other galaxies.
                   We discuss the implications for galactic-scale star
                   formation and supermassive black hole growth, and
                   relate our results to the star formation conditions
                   in other extreme environments.},

                   the observables of those systems. Our calculation is
                   based on three premises: (1) star formation occurs in
                   virialized molecular clouds that are supersonically

                   importance of gravitational, turbulent, magnetic, and
                   thermal energies, expressed through the virial
                   parameter, alphavir, the rms sonic Mach number,
                   M_S,0, and the ratio of mean gas pressure to mean

                   dense starless and star-forming cores with the
                   particular goal to identify and understand
                   evolutionary trends in core properties, and to
                   explore the nature of Very Low Luminosity Objects
                   (<=0.1 L&sun;; VeLLOs). Methods: Using the MAMBO
                   bolometer array, we create maps unusually sensitive
                   to faint (few mJy per beam) extended (≈5 arcmin)
                   thermal dust continuum emission at 1.2 mm wavelength.
                   Complementary information on embedded stars is
                   obtained from Spitzer, IRAS, and 2MASS. Results: Our
                   maps are very rich in structure, and we characterize
                   extended emission features (``subcores'') and compact
                   intensity peaks in our data separately to pay
                   attention to this complexity. We derive, e.g., sizes,
                   masses, and aspect ratios for the subcores, as well
                   as column densities and related properties for the
                   peaks. Combination with archival infrared data then
                   enables the derivation of bolometric luminosities and
                   temperatures, as well as envelope masses, for the
                   young embedded stars. Conclusions: Starless and
                   star-forming cores occupy the same parameter space in
                   many core properties; a picture of dense core
                   evolution in which any dense core begins to actively
                   form stars once it exceeds some fixed limit in, e.g.,
                   mass, density, or both, is inconsistent with our
                   data. A concept of necessary conditions for star
                   formation appears to provide a better description:
                   dense cores fulfilling certain conditions can form
                   stars, but they do not need to, respectively have not
                   done so yet. Comparison of various evolutionary
                   indicators for young stellar objects in our sample
                   (e.g., bolometric temperatures) reveals
                   inconsistencies between some of them, possibly
                   suggesting a revision of some of these indicators.
                   Finally, we challenge the notion that VeLLOs form in
                   cores not expected to actively form stars, and we
                   present a first systematic study revealing evidence
                   for structural differences between starless and
                   candidate VeLLO cores. Based on observations with the

                   most star-forming gas clouds close to isothermal as
                   they collapse, and this favours fragmentation into
                   stars of one solar mass or lower. Heating of a cloud
                   by accreting low-mass stars within it can prevent
                   fragmentation and allow formation of massive stars,
                   but the necessary properties for a cloud to form
                   massive stars-and therefore where massive stars form
                   in a galaxy-have not yet been determined. Here we
                   show that only clouds with column densities of at
                   least 1gcm-2 can avoid fragmentation and form massive
                   stars. This threshold, and the environmental
                   variation of the stellar initial mass function that
                   it implies, naturally explain the characteristic
                   column densities associated with massive star
                   clusters and the difference between the radial
                   profiles of Halpha and ultraviolet emission in
                   galactic disks. The existence of a threshold also
                   implies that the initial mass function should show
                   detectable variation with environment within the
                   Galaxy, that the characteristic column densities of
                   clusters containing massive stars should vary between
                   galaxies, and that star formation rates in some

                   explaining the low star formation activity. Instead,
                   cores with low densities and line widths <~ 1 km
                   s-1---probably the narrowest lines reported for the
                   GC region to date---are found. Evolution over several
                   105 yr is needed before more massive cores, and
                   possibly an Arches-like stellar cluster, could form.
                   Given the disruptive dynamics of the GC region, and
                   the potentially unbound nature of G0.253+0.016, it is
                   not clear that this evolution will happen.},

  abstract =      {We report the discovery and characterization of a
                   power-law correlation between the local surface
                   densities of Spitzer-identified, dusty young stellar
                   objects (YSOs) and the column density of gas (as
                   traced by near-IR extinction) in eight molecular
                   clouds within 1 kpc and with 100 or more known YSOs.
                   This correlation, which appears in data smoothed over
                   size scales of ~1 pc, varies in quality from cloud to
                   cloud; those clouds with tight correlations, MonR2
                   and Ophiuchus, are fit with power laws of slope 2.67
                   and 1.87, respectively. The spread in the correlation
                   is attributed primarily to local gas disruption by
                   stars that formed there or to the presence of very
                   young subregions at the onset of star formation. We
                   explore the ratio of the number of Class II to Class
                   I sources, a proxy for the star formation age of a
                   region, as a function of gas column density; this
                   analysis reveals a declining Class II to Class I
                   ratio with increasing column density. We show that
                   the observed star-gas correlation is consistent with
                   a star formation law where the star formation rate
                   per area varies with the gas column density squared.
                   We also propose a simple picture of thermal
                   fragmentation of dense gas in an isothermal,
                   self-gravitating layer as an explanation for the
                   power law. Finally, we briefly compare the star-gas
                   correlation and its implied star formation law with
                   other recent proposed of star formation laws at
                   similar and larger size scales from nearby

                   have confidently identified and classified 2548 young
                   stellar objects (YSOs) using recently established
                   mid-infrared color-based methods. We have devised and
                   applied a new algorithm for the isolation of local
                   surface density enhancements from point source
                   distributions, enabling us to extract the overdense
                   cores of the observed star-forming regions for
                   further analysis. We have compiled several basic
                   structural measurements of these cluster cores from
                   the data, such as mean surface densities of sources,
                   cluster core radii, and aspect ratios, in order to
                   characterize the ranges for these quantities. We find
                   that a typical cluster core is 0.39 pc in radius, has
                   26 members with infrared excess in a ratio of Class
                   II to Class I sources of 3.7, is embedded in a AK =
                   0.8 mag cloud clump, and has a surface density of 60
                   pc-2. We examine the nearest neighbor distances among
                   the YSOs in several ways, demonstrating similarity in
                   the spacings between Class II and Class I sources but
                   large member clusters appear more dense than smaller
                   clusters. We demonstrate that near-uniform source
                   spacings in cluster cores are common, suggesting that
                   simple Jeans fragmentation of parsec-scale cloud
                   clumps may be the dominant process governing star
                   formation in nearby clusters and groups. Finally, we

                   taken with the Bell Labs 7 m telescope by Bally et

                   ridge of emission or an 'Edge' seen at VLSR = 50 to

                   scenario in which a dense, massive (106 solar mass)
                   cloud (Clump) approximately 10 pc in diameter has
                   collided, at a relative velocity of approximately 30

                   molecular cloud complex in the Galactic center
                   region, and has created a hole with a bow shock (Hole
                   and Shell). In the course of this collision, dense
                   and massive molecular cloud cores may have formed at
                   the interface between the colliding clouds, and their
                   collapse resulted in the current burst of massive
                   star formation in the Sgr B2 complex. This is the
                   clearest observed case of a collision event between
                   giant molecular clouds that triggers intense
                   formation of massive (O-ty pe) stars.},

                   more restricted central area was also mapped in the

                   roughly centered on Sgr B2(M) and an extended plateau
                   of ~17 pc × 7.5 pc area containing the maser sources

                   molecular cloud at higher velocity, where a shock
                   seems to have occurred. These results provide further
                   evidence supporting the cloud-cloud collision
                   hypothesis based on limited 13CO (1-0) data. In
                   addition, this hypothesis appears to be consistent

                   in position-velocity diagrams that appear as a result
                   of cloud-cloud collisions. Broad bridges will have a
                   finite lifetime due to the action of feedback,
                   conversion of gas into stars and the time-scale of
                   the collision. We make a series of analytic arguments
                   with which to estimate these lifetimes. Our simple
                   analytic arguments suggest that for collisions
                   between clouds larger than R ˜ 10 pc the lifetime of
                   the broad bridge is more likely to be determined by
                   the lifetime of the collision rather than the
                   radiative or wind feedback disruption time-scale.
                   However, for smaller clouds feedback becomes much
                   more effective. This is because the radiative
                   feedback time-scale scales with the ionizing flux Nly
                   as R^{7/4}N_{ly}^{-1/4} so a reduction in cloud size
                   requires a relatively large decrease in ionizing
                   photons to maintain a given time-scale. We find that
                   our analytic arguments are consistent with new
                   synthetic observations of numerical simulations of
                   cloud-cloud collisions (including star formation and
                   radiative feedback). We also argue that if the number
                   of observable broad bridges remains ˜ constant, then
                   the disruption time-scale must be roughly equivalent
                   to the collision rate. If this is the case, our
                   analytic arguments also provide collision rate
                   estimates, which we find are readily consistent with
                   previous theoretical models at the scales they
                   consider (clouds larger than about 10 pc) but are
                   much higher for smaller clouds.},

                   that perform automated spectral line fitting on
                   broad-band line data. We describe the line-fitting
                   procedure, evaluate the performance of the method,
                   and provide access to all data and scripts. The
                   scripts are used to characterize the spectra at the
                   positions of three H II regions, each with
                   recombination line emission and molecular line
                   absorption. Towards the most line-dense of the three
                   regions characterized in this work, we detect ˜500

                   The data reveal extremely sub-thermally excited
                   molecular gas absorbing against the continuum

                   molecular abundances and line excitation in the
                   absorbing components appear to vary substantially
                   towards the different positions, possibly indicating
                   that the two gas clouds are located proximate to the
                   star-forming cores instead of within the envelope of
                   Sgr B2. Furthermore, the spatial distributions of
                   species including CS, OCS, SiO, and HNCO indicate
                   that the absorbing gas components likely have high

                   cloud. All the K components of all CH_3_CN lines are
                   observed in emission except towards Sgr B2M where we
                   have detected the J=5-4, K=4 and J=6-5, K=5 lines in
                   absorption. CH_3_CN and HC_3_N show a ridge of strong
                   emission along a north-south direction which contains
                   the star forming regions Sgr B2M, Sgr B2N and Sgr
                   B2S. The kinematics of the molecular gas shows four
                   major molecular clouds with radial velocities of
                   44-54, 55-66, 67-78 and 90-120km/s and sizes of a few
                   parsecs. The main molecular cloud with a radial
                   velocity of 55-66km/s is observed over the whole
                   region. Maps of the kinetic temperature and density
                   derived from an LVG analysis of the CH_3_CN data are
                   presented for the molecular clouds at 44-54, 55-66
                   and 67-78km/s. The kinetic temperature for the three
                   clouds ranges between 40-400K, while the density is
                   ~10^5^cm^-3^ for all clouds. The total mass in these
                   clouds is 3.10^6^Msun_, with 70% of the mass in the
                   55-66km/s molecular cloud. This cloud reveals the
                   presence of four different components: the hot cores,
                   the warm envelope, the very hot component and the hot
                   ring. The largest kinetic temperatures (200-400K) are
                   found towards the hot cores associated to the star
                   forming regions Sgr B2M and Sgr B2N, with sizes of
                   0.5 and 0.7pc respectively. Two new cores close to
                   Sgr B2N with sizes of 0.3 pc have been found. H_2_
                   densities for the hot cores are 10^6^-10^7^cm^-3^.
                   The mass in the cores is typically 10^3^-10^4^Msun_.
                   The warm envelope extends over the whole region; this
                   has a uniform kinetic temperature, between 40-80K.
                   The kinetic temperatures are higher than the dust
                   temperatures at distances larger than 1pc. The
                   density in the warm envelope decreases with distance
                   as n(H_2_)=2.96x10^5^cm^-3^(r/pc)^-0.87^. The
                   analysis of the absorption lines in the J=K
                   components of the J=5-4 and J=6-5 lines shows the
                   presence of a hotter and more diffuse envelope
                   probably surrounding the warm envelope. An analysis
                   of our data gives a kinetic temperature of 300K and a
                   density of ~10^3^cm^-3^. The kinetic temperature maps
                   reveal, for the first time, the presence of a ring of
                   hot gas (100-120K) surrounding Sgr B2M and Sgr B2N
                   with a radius of 2pc and a thickness of 1.4pc. Our
                   data suggest that the density in the hot ring is
                   similar to that in the warm envelope. The high
                   temperature of the hot cores and the kinetic
                   temperature distribution for distances smaller than
                   1pc can be accounted for by gas-dust collisional
                   heating. This temperature is consistent with the
                   total luminosity of the central sources Sgr B2M and
                   Sgr B2N. In contrast, the dust temperatures in the
                   warm envelope are too low (10-20K) to heat the warm
                   envelope molecular gas by this mechanism. Heating by
                   dissipation of turbulent motions in the envelope of
                   Sgr B2 can explain the high gas kinetic temperatures.
                   The presence of the hot ring suggests the existence
                   of another heating mechanism. The morphology of the
                   hot ring which surrounds the 50mum and the radio
                   continuum emission of Sgr B2M and Sgr B2N suggests
                   that this feature might be associated to the
                   interface between the warm envelope and the ionized
                   bubble created by the OB stars recently formed in the
                   Sgr B2 core. In this interface, heating by UV photons
                   and or shock fronts produced by the expansion of the
                   ionized gas could explain the hot ring.},

                   observations of the Galactic center (GC) region by
                   Nord and coworkers have revealed 20 nonthermal
                   filament (NTF) candidates. We report 6 cm
                   polarization observations of six of these. All of the
                   candidates have the expected NTF morphology, and two
                   show extended polarization, confirming their
                   identification as NTFs. One of the new NTFs appears
                   to be part of a system of NTFs located in the Sgr B
                   region, 64 pc in projection north of Sgr A. These
                   filaments cross the Galactic plane with an
                   orientation similar to the filaments in the Galactic
                   center radio arc. They extend the scale over which
                   the NTF phenomena is known to occur to almost 300 pc
                   along the Galactic plane. Another NTF was found in
                   the Galactic plane south of the Sgr C filament but
                   with an orientation of 45$\,^{\circ}$ to the Galactic
                   plane. This is only the second of 12 confirmed NTFs
                   that is not oriented perpendicular to the Galactic
                   plane. An additional candidate in the Sgr C region
                   was resolved into multiple filamentary structures.
                   Polarization was detected only at the brightness peak
                   of one of the filaments. Several of these filaments
                   run parallel to the Galactic plane and can be
                   considered additional evidence for nonpoloidal
                   magnetic fields at the GC. Together the 90 and 6 cm
                   observations indicate that the GC magnetic field may
                   be more complex than a simple globally ordered
                   dipolar field.},

                   molecular cloud at 1384 and 2368 MHz obtained using
                   new, multi-configuration Australia Telescope Compact
                   Array observations. We have combined these
                   observations with archival single-dish observations
                   yielding images at resolutions of 47'' × 14'' and
                   27'' × 8'' at 1384 and 2368 MHz, respectively. These
                   observations were motivated by our theoretical work
                   indicating the possibility that synchrotron emission
                   from secondary electrons and positrons created in
                   hadronic cosmic ray (CR) collisions with the ambient
                   matter of the Sgr B2 cloud could provide a detectable
                   (and possibly linearly polarized) non-thermal radio
                   signal. We find that the only detectable non-thermal
                   emission from the Sgr B region is from a strong
                   source to the south of Sgr B2, which we label Sgr B2
                   Southern Complex (SC). We find Sgr B2(SC) integrated
                   flux densities of 1.2 $\pm$ 0.2 Jy at 1384 MHz and
                   0.7 $\pm$ 0.1 Jy at 2368 MHz for a source of FWHM
                   size at 1384 MHz of ~54''. Despite its non-thermal
                   nature, the synchrotron emission from this source is
                   unlikely to be dominated due to secondary electrons
                   and positrons. Failing to find clear evidence of
                   non-thermal emission due to secondary electrons and
                   positrons, we use polarization data to place 5sigma
                   upper limits on the level of polarized intensity from
                   the Sgr B2 cloud of 3.5 and 3 mJybeam-1 at 1384 and
                   2368 MHz, respectively. We also use the angular
                   distribution of the total intensity of archival 330
                   MHz Very Large Array and the total intensity and
                   polarized emission of our new 1384 and 2368 MHz data
                   to constrain the diffusion coefficient for transport
                   of the parent hadronic CRs into the dense core of Sgr
                   B2 to be no larger than about 1% of that in the
                   Galactic disk. Finally, we have also used the data to
                   perform a spectral and morphological study of the
                   features of the Sgr B cloud and compare and contrast
                   these to previous studies.},

                   column density is consistent with a radial Gaussian
                   density profile with a standard deviation of 2.75 pc.
                   Deriving a formula for the virial mass of spherical
                   Gaussian clouds, we obtain Mvir = 1.9 × 106Msolar
                   for Sgr B2. For this matter distribution, a
                   reasonable magnetic field and an impinging flux of
                   cosmic rays of solar neighbourhood intensity, we
                   predict the expected synchrotron emission from the
                   Sgr B2 giant molecular cloud due to secondary
                   electrons and positrons resulting from cosmic-ray
                   interactions, including effects of losses due to pion
                   production collisions during diffusive propagation
                   into the cloud complex. We assemble radio-continuum
                   data at frequencies between 330 MHz and 230 GHz. From
                   the spectral-energy distribution, the emission
                   appears to be thermal at all frequencies. Before
                   using these data to constrain the predicted
                   synchrotron flux, we first model the spectrum as
                   free-free emission from the known ultra compact HII
                   regions plus emission from an envelope or wind with a
                   radial-density gradient, and obtain an excellent fit.
                   We thus find the spectrum at all frequencies to be
                   dominated by thermal emission, and this severely
                   constrains the possible synchrotron emission by
                   secondary electrons to quite low-flux levels. The
                   absence of a significant contribution by secondary
                   electrons is almost certainly due to multi-GeV energy
                   cosmic rays being unable to penetrate far into giant
                   molecular clouds. This would also explain why 100
                   MeV-GeV gamma-rays (from neutral pion decay or
                   bremsstrahlung by secondary electrons) were not
                   observed from Sgr B2 by the EGRET instrument on the
                   Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, while TeV energy
                   gamma-rays were observed by the High Energy
                   Stereoscopic System (HESS), being produced by higher
                   energy cosmic rays which more readily penetrate giant
                   molecular clouds.},

                   provide strong constraints on the process of massive
                   star formation. We have performed simulations of the
                   gravitational collapse of rotating molecular cloud
                   cores, including treatments of the propagation of
                   ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. We here present
                   synthetic radio continuum observations of H II
                   regions from our collapse simulations, to investigate
                   how well they agree with observation, and what we can
                   learn about how massive star formation proceeds. We
                   find that intermittent shielding by dense filaments
                   in the gravitationally unstable accretion flow around
                   the massive star leads to highly variable H II
                   regions that do not grow monotonically, but rather
                   flicker, growing and shrinking repeatedly. This
                   behavior appears to be able to resolve the well-known
                   lifetime problem. We find that multiple ionizing
                   sources generally form, resulting in groups of UC H
                   II regions, consistent with observations. We confirm
                   that our model reproduces the qualitative H II region
                   morphologies found in surveys, with generally
                   consistent relative frequencies. We also find that
                   simulated spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from
                   our model are consistent with the range of observed H
                   II region SEDs, including both regions showing a
                   normal transition from optically thick to optically
                   thin emission, and those with intermediate spectral
                   slopes. In our models, anomalous slopes are solely
                   produced by inhomogeneities in the H II region, with
                   no contribution from dust emission at millimeter or
                   submillimeter wavelengths. We conclude that many
                   observed characteristics of UC H II regions appear
                   consistent with massive star formation in fast,

                   regions of ionized gas with diameters smaller than
                   ˜0.1 pc. H II regions are expected to expand at
                   velocities of the order of the sound speed (10 km
                   s-1) until reaching equilibrium at dimensions of a
                   few pc. In regions with density of n0 ˜105cm-3, H II
                   regions should remain ultracompact for ˜3000 years
                   and only a few dozen should exist in the Galaxy.
                   However, observations suggest that many more UCHIIs
                   exist and that lifetimes should be one to two orders
                   of magnitude larger. Several models have been
                   proposed to explain this "lifetime paradox"; all have
                   shortcomings. The paradox could be resolved if the
                   molecular gas in which an O star forms is denser and
                   warmer than previously believed, resulting in an
                   initial Str{\"o}mgren sphere much smaller than
                   originally estimated. This suggestion finds support
                   in observations which show that in dense molecular
                   cloud cores densities of 107cm-3 and temperatures of
                   100 K are not atypical. The authors compare the
                   expected UCHII radii (using the higher temperatures
                   and densities) with the observed radii of a sample of
                   UCHIIs and find significant agreement between the
                   two.},

  abstract =      {We present a theoretical framework in which bound
                   stellar clusters arise naturally at the high-density
                   end of the hierarchy of the interstellar medium
                   (ISM). Due to short free-fall times, these
                   high-density regions achieve high local star
                   formation efficiencies, enabling them to form bound
                   clusters. Star-forming regions of lower density
                   remain substructured and gas-rich, ending up unbound
                   when the residual gas is expelled. Additionally, the
                   tidal perturbation of star-forming regions by nearby,
                   dense giant molecular clouds imposes a minimum
                   density contrast required for the collapse to a bound
                   cluster. The fraction of all star formation that
                   occurs in bound stellar clusters (the cluster
                   formation efficiency, hereafter CFE) follows by
                   integration of these local clustering and survival
                   properties over the full density spectrum of the ISM,
                   and hence is set by galaxy-scale physics. We derive
                   the CFE as a function of observable galaxy
                   properties, and find that it increases with the gas
                   surface density, from Gamma ˜ 1 per cent in
                   low-density galaxies to a peak value of Gamma ˜ 70
                   per cent at densities of Sigmag ˜ 103 M&sun; pc-2.
                   This explains the observation that the CFE increases
                   with the star formation rate density in nearby dwarf,
                   spiral and starburst galaxies. Indeed, comparing our
                   model results with observed galaxies yields excellent
                   agreement. The model is applied further by
                   calculating the spatial variation of the CFE within
                   single galaxies. We also consider the variation of
                   the CFE with cosmic time and show that it increases
                   with redshift, peaking in high-redshift, gas-rich
                   disc galaxies. It is estimated that up to 30-35 per
                   cent of all stars in the Universe once formed in
                   bound stellar clusters. We discuss how our theory can
                   be verified with Gaia and ALMA, and provide possible
                   implementations for theoretical work and for
                   simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

                   M&sun;, age ≲ 100 Myr) have been identified in
                   significant numbers, their progenitor gas clouds have
                   eluded detection. Recently, four extreme molecular
                   clouds residing within 200 pc of the Galactic Centre
                   have been identified as having the properties thought
                   necessary to form YMCs. Here, we utilize far-IR
                   continuum data from the Herschel infrared Galactic
                   Plane Survey (HiGAL) and millimetre spectral line
                   data from the Millimetre Astronomy Legacy Team 90 GHz
                   Survey to determine their global physical and
                   kinematic structure. We derive their masses, dust
                   temperatures and radii and use virial analysis to
                   conclude that they are all likely gravitationally
                   bound - confirming that they are likely YMC
                   progenitors. We then compare the density profiles of
                   these clouds to those of the gas and stellar
                   components of the Sagittarius B2 Main and North
                   protoclusters and the stellar distribution of the
                   Arches YMC. We find that even in these clouds - the
                   most massive and dense quiescent clouds in the Galaxy
                   - the gas is not compact enough to form an
                   Arches-like (M = 2 × 104 M&sun;, Reff = 0.4 pc)
                   stellar distribution. Further dynamical processes
                   would be required to condense the resultant
                   population, indicating that the mass becomes more
                   centrally concentrated as the (proto)cluster evolves.
                   These results suggest that YMC formation may proceed
                   hierarchically rather than through monolithic
                   collapse.},

                   is currently unknown whether the stars formed at such
                   high (proto)stellar densities. We compile a sample of
                   gas clouds in the Galaxy which have sufficient gas
                   mass within a radius of a few parsecs to form a YMC,
                   and compare their radial gas mass distributions to
                   the stellar mass distribution of Galactic YMCs. We
                   find that the gas in the progenitor clouds is
                   distributed differently than the stars in YMCs. The
                   mass surface density profiles of the gas clouds are
                   generally shallower than the stellar mass surface
                   density profiles of the YMCs, which are characterized
                   by prominent dense core regions with radii ˜0.1 pc,
                   followed by a power-law tail. On the scale of YMC
                   core radii, we find that there are no known clouds
                   with significantly more mass in their central regions
                   when compared to Galactic YMCs. Additionally, we find
                   that models in which stars form from very dense
                   initial conditions require surface densities that are
                   generally higher than those seen in the known
                   candidate YMC progenitor clouds. Our results show
                   that the quiescent, less evolved clouds contain less
                   mass in their central regions than in the highly
                   star-forming clouds. This suggests an evolutionary
                   trend in which clouds continue to accumulate mass
                   towards their centres after the onset of star
                   formation. We conclude that a conveyor-belt scenario
                   for YMC formation is consistent with the current
                   sample of Galactic YMCs and their progenitor clouds.},

                   has been observed at 800 micron by Lis & Carlstrom
                   (1994); the SHARC map has better spatial resolution
                   and sensitivity to extended emission, however. This
                   paper introduces several features not visible in
                   prior maps of dust emission. We have detected a 10+
                   pc band of emission peaking at l = -0.14
                   $\,^{\circ}$, b = +0.02$\,^{\circ}$, which is

                   observed in 13CO (Bally et al. 1988). We suggest an
                   association of a rounded 350 micron feature near the
                   Radio Arc with an expanding shell observed in CS

                   as well as a compact source at the base of a thermal

                   dust emission within a few arc-minutes of the Sgr D

                   but only one out of four OH masers (Mehringer et al.
                   1998). The mean 350 micron /800 micron flux ratio for
                   the Galactic center is approximately 17 (beta ~ 2.0)
                   over the map but is higher (beta ~ 2.5) in parts of

  abstract =      {Aims: We present the first public release of
                   high-quality data products (DR1) from Hi-GAL, the
                   Herschel infrared Galactic Plane Survey. Hi-GAL is
                   the keystone of a suite of continuum Galactic plane
                   surveys from the near-IR to the radio and covers five
                   wavebands at 70, 160, 250, 350 and 500 mum,
                   encompassing the peak of the spectral energy
                   distribution of cold dust for 8 ≲ T ≲ 50 K. This
                   first Hi-GAL data release covers the inner Milky Way
                   in the longitude range 68$\,^{\circ}$ ≳ l ≳
                   -70$\,^{\circ}$ in a | b | <= 1$\,^{\circ}$ latitude
                   strip. Methods: Photometric maps have been produced
                   with the ROMAGAL pipeline, which optimally
                   capitalizes on the excellent sensitivity and
                   stability of the bolometer arrays of the Herschel
                   PACS and SPIRE photometric cameras. It delivers
                   images of exquisite quality and dynamical range,
                   absolutely calibrated with Planck and IRAS, and
                   recovers extended emission at all wavelengths and all
                   spatial scales, from the point-spread function to the
                   size of an entire 2$\,^{\circ}$× 2$\,^{\circ}$
                   "tile" that is the unit observing block of the
                   survey. The compact source catalogues were generated
                   with the CuTEx algorithm, which was specifically
                   developed to optimise source detection and extraction
                   in the extreme conditions of intense and spatially
                   varying background that are found in the Galactic
                   plane in the thermal infrared. Results: Hi-GAL DR1
                   images are cirrus noise limited and reach the
                   1sigma-rms predicted by the Herschel Time Estimators
                   for parallel-mode observations at 60'' s-1 scanning
                   speed in relatively low cirrus emission regions.
                   Hi-GAL DR1 images will be accessible through a
                   dedicated web-based image cutout service. The DR1
                   Compact Source Catalogues are delivered as
                   single-band photometric lists containing, in addition
                   to source position, peak, and integrated flux and
                   source sizes, a variety of parameters useful to
                   assess the quality and reliability of the extracted
                   sources. Caveats and hints to help in this assessment
                   are provided. Flux completeness limits in all bands
                   are determined from extensive synthetic source
                   experiments and greatly depend on the specific line
                   of sight along the Galactic plane because the
                   background strongly varies as a function of Galactic
                   longitude. Hi-GAL DR1 catalogues contain 123210,
                   308509, 280685, 160972, and 85460 compact sources in
                   the five bands. Herschel is an ESA space observatory
                   with science instruments provided by European-led

  abstract =      {We present a re-reduction and expansion of the
                   Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS), first presented
                   by Aguirre et al. and Rosolowsky et al. The BGPS is a
                   1.1 mm survey of dust emission in the Northern
                   galactic plane, covering longitudes -10$\,^{\circ}$ <
                   l < 90$\,^{\circ}$ and latitudes |b| <
                   0.$\,^{\circ}$5 with a typical 1sigma rms sensitivity
                   of 30-100 mJy in a ~33'' beam. Version 2 of the
                   survey includes an additional ~20 deg2 of coverage in
                   the third and fourth quadrants and ~2 deg2 in the
                   first quadrant. The new data release has improved
                   angular recovery, with complete recovery out to ~80''
                   and partial recovery to ~300'', and reduced negative
                   bowls around bright sources resulting from the
                   atmospheric subtraction process. We resolve the
                   factor of 1.5 flux calibration offset between the
                   v1.0 data release and other data sets and determine
                   that there is no offset between v2.0 and other data
                   sets. The v2.0 pointing accuracy is tested against
                   other surveys and is demonstrated to be accurate and
                   an improvement over v1.0. We present simulations and
                   tests of the pipeline and its properties, including
                   measurements of the pipeline's angular transfer
                   function. The Bolocat cataloging tool was used to
                   extract a new catalog, which includes 8594 sources,
                   with 591 in the expanded regions. We have
                   demonstrated that the Bolocat 40'' and 80'' apertures
                   are accurate even in the presence of strong extended
                   background emission. The number of sources is lower
                   than in v1.0, but the amount of flux and area
                   included in identified sources is larger.},

                   of 5120 bolometers in each of two simultaneous
                   imaging bands centred over 450 and 850 mum. The
                   camera is operated by scanning across the sky and
                   recording data at a rate of 200 Hz. As the largest of

                   cameras operating in the (sub)millimetre, SCUBA-2
                   data analysis represents a significant challenge. We
                   describe the production of maps using SMURF
                   (Sub-Millimetre User Reduction Facility) in which we
                   have adopted a fast, iterative approach to map-making
                   that enables data reduction on single, modern,
                   high-end desktop computers, with execution times that
                   are typically shorter than the observing times. SMURF
                   is used in an automated setting, both at the
                   telescope for real-time feedback to observers and for

                   Science Archive at the Canadian Astronomy Data

                   explore convergence properties of the map-maker using
                   simple prior constraints (Uranus - a point source);
                   (ii) achieve the white-noise limit for faint
                   point-source studies (extragalactic blank-field
                   survey of the Lockman Hole); and (iii) demonstrate
                   that our strategy is capable of recovering angular
                   scales comparable to the size of the array footprint
                   (approximately 5 arcmin) for bright extended sources

  year =          {2016},
  abstract =      {Context. Probability distribution functions (PDFs) of
                   column densities are an established tool to
                   characterize the evolutionary state of interstellar
                   clouds. Aims: Using simulations, we show to what
                   degree their determination is affected by noise,
                   line-of-sight contamination, field selection, and the
                   incomplete sampling in interferometric measurements.
                   Methods: We solve the integrals that describe the
                   convolution of a cloud PDF with contaminating sources
                   such as noise and line-of-sight emission, and study
                   the impact of missing information on the measured
                   column density PDF. In this way we can quantify the
                   effect of the different processes and propose ways to
                   correct for their impact to recover the intrinsic PDF
                   of the observed cloud. Results: The effect of
                   observational noise can be easily estimated and
                   corrected for if the root mean square (rms) of the
                   noise is known. For sigmanoise values below 40% of
                   the typical cloud column density, Npeak, this
                   involves almost no degradation in the accuracy of the
                   PDF parameters. For higher noise levels and narrow
                   cloud PDFs the width of the PDF becomes increasingly
                   uncertain. A contamination by turbulent foreground or
                   background clouds can be removed as a constant shield
                   if the peak of the contamination PDF falls at a lower
                   column or is narrower than that of the observed
                   cloud. Uncertainties in cloud boundary definition
                   mainly affect the low-column density part of the PDF
                   and the mean density. As long as more than 50% of a
                   cloud is covered, the impact on the PDF parameters is
                   negligible. In contrast, the incomplete sampling of
                   the uv-plane in interferometric observations leads to
                   uncorrectable PDF distortions in the maps produced.
                   An extension of the capabilities of the Atacama Large
                   Millimeter Array (ALMA) would allow us to recover the
                   high-column density tail of the PDF, but we found no
                   way to measure the intermediate- and low-column
                   density part of the underlying cloud PDF in
                   interferometric observations.},
