\begin{abstract}
We report the detection of $>100$ sources in the Sgr B2 clouds with extents
smaller than 5000 AU.  These sources are most likely to be protostars or
centrally condensed prestellar cores.  The spatial distribution of these sources
demonstrates that Sgr B2 is experiencing a highly extended star formation
event, not just an isolated `starburst' within the protocluster regions M, N,
and S.

\section{Introduction}
The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy appears to be overall deficient
in star formation relative to the gas mass it contains \citep{Longmore2013a,
Kauffmann2016a,Kauffmann2016b,Barnes2016c,Barnes2017b}.  This deficiency
suggests that star formation laws, i.e., the empirical relations between
the star formation rate and gas density, are not universal.  The gas
conditions in the Galactic center provide a powerful lever-arm in a few
parameters \citep[e.g., pressure, temperature, velocity
dispersion][]{Ginsburg2016a,Immer2016a,Shetty2012a,Henshaw2016a} to assess the
influence of environmental effects on star formation.

The observations that have demonstrated the star formation deficiency compare
bulk tracers of star formation to $\gtrsim0.1$ pc resolution gas observations
\citep[e.g.]{Barnes2017b}.  More recently, high-resolution observations
of selected clouds in the CMZ have revealed very few star-forming cores
even when examined at high resolution and sensitivity
\citep{Rathborne2015a,Kauffmann2016a,Kauffmann2016b}.  The only sites with
obvious signs of ongoing star formation along the CMZ dust ridge are
the Sgr B2 N, M, and S protoclusters \citep{Schmiedeke2016a} and, at a much
lower level, Clouds C, D, and E \citep[][Walker et al, in prep; Barnes et al,
in prep]{Ginsburg2015b}.  These regions contain a handful of high-mass cores
detected with ALMA, but only a small number of protostars.

We report the first observations of extended, ongoing star formation in a
Galactic center cloud \emph{not} isolated to a centralized protocluster dust
clump.  We observed the entire Sgr B2 cloud and identified star formation along
the entire molecular dust ridge known as Sgr B2 Deep South (DS).
These observations allow us to perform the first star-counting based
determination of the star formation rate within the molecular gas of
the CMZ.

We describe the observations in Section \ref{sec:observations}. In this paper,
we focus on the continuum sources, which we identify in Section
\ref{sec:contsources}.  We classify the sources in Section
\ref{sec:classification}.  


\section{Observation and Data Reduction}
\label{sec:observations}
Data were acquired as part of ALMA project 2013.1.00269.S.  Observations were
taken with the 12m Total Power array, the ALMA 7m array, and in two
configurations with the ALMA 12m array.  The setup included the maximum allowed
number of channels, 30720, across 4 spectral windows in a single polarization;
the single-polarization mode was adopted to support moderate spectral resolution
across the broad bandwidth.

The ALMA QA2 calibrated measurement sets were combined to make a single
high-resolution, high-dynamic range data set.  We imaged the continuum jointly
across all four bands, and found that the central regions surrounding Sgr B2M
were severely affected by artifacts that could not be cleaned out.  We
therefore ran 3 iterations of phase-only self-calibration and one iteration of
amplitude + phase self-calibration to yield a substantially improved image.
The total dynamic range, measured as the peak brightness in Sgr B2 to the RMS
noise in a signal-free region of the image, is 22000 (noise $\sim0.08$
mJy/beam), while the dynamic range within one primary beam ($\sim0.5$\arcmin)
of Sgr B2M is only 3700 (noise $\sim0.5$ mJy/beam).  Because of the dynamic
range limitations, and an empirical determination that clean did not converge
if allowed to go too deep, we cleaned to a threshold of 0.5 mJy/beam across the
image.  We performed this same process for both the longest-baseline data only
(resolution $\sim0.5\arcsec$, largest angular scale theoretically 15\arcsec\
[the shortest baseline] but more practically $\sim7$\arcsec\ [the 5th percentile
baseline length]) and the merged 7m + two 12m configuration data.  The merged
data are more useful for studying extended structures but have lower dynamic
range, while the long-baseline-only data are excellent for extracting and
analyzing pointlike or compact sources.

We also produced cubes of all of the spectral lines.  These were lightly
cleaned with only 200 iterations of cleaning.  No self-calibration was applied.
Before continuum subtraction, dynamic range related artifacts similar to those
in the continuum images were present, but these structures are identical across
frequencies, and were therefore removable in the image domain.  We use
median-subtracted cubes for the majority of our analysis, noting that the only
location in which an error on the continuum $>5\%$ is expected is the Sgr B2
North core \citep{Sanchez-Monge2017a}.

\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Continuum Source Identification}
\label{sec:contsources}
We selected continuum point sources as candidate cores or protostars by eye.
An automated selection is not viable across the majority of the field because
there are many extended \hii regions that dominate the overall map emission.  A
future automated selection algorithm may work if images at comparable
resolution at other frequencies become available; the \hii-region sources could
then be excluded.  Additionally, however, there are substantial imaging
artifacts produced by the extremely bright emission sources in Sgr B2 M ($S_{3
mm,max} > 0.8$ Jy) and Sgr B2 N ($S_{3 mm,max} > 0.3$ Jy) that make automated
source identification particularly challenging in the most source-dense regions.

Because the noise varies significantly across the map, a uniform selection
criterion is not possible.  We therefore include two levels of source
identification, `high confidence' sources, which are selected conservatively in
regions of low-background, and `low-confidence' sources that are somewhat lower
signal-to-noise and are often in regions with higher background.  Both of
these selection criteria are significantly more conservative than a local
$5-\sigma$ threshold.

We measure the local noise for each source by taking the median absolute
deviation in an annulus 0.5 to 1.5 \arcsec around the source center.
All but 7 sources have signal-to-local-noise ratios $S/N>7$.  These
sources are all in regions of particularly high background or source
density and therefore have overestimated local noise.

Our selection criteria result in a reliable but potentially incomplete catalog.

\section{Results}

We detected \ncores compact continuum sources.  Their flux distribution is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:fluxhist}.


\subsection{Source Classification}
\label{sec:classification}
For the majority of the detected sources, we have only a continuum detection at
3 mm.  No lines are detected peaking toward most of the sources, especially the
faint ones.  A subset have detections at other bands and can be classified
based on previous literature work, especially those associated with \hii
regions detected at 0.7 and 1.3 cm
\citep{Gaume1995a,Mehringer1995b,de-Pree1996a,Pree2015a}.  In this section, we
employ various means to classify the sample of new sources.

\Figure{figures/core_peak_fluxdensity_powerlawfit.png}
{A histogram of the peak flux density of the observed sources excluding known
\hii regions with a powerlaw fit shown.  The fitted powerlaw is an excellent
fit to the data, but is far shallower than the IMF slope, with
$\alpha=1.94\pm0.07$.  The two brightest regions are Sgr B2M f1 and Sgr B2N K2,
which may be dominated by free-free emission but likely also contain a large
dust mass.}
{fig:fluxhist}{1}{\textwidth}

We first note some key properties of dust at 3 mm.   At 8.4 kpc, a 1 mJy source
corresponds to an optically thin dust mass of $M(40\mathrm{K})=18$ \msun or
$M(20\mathrm{K})=38$ \msun assuming a dust opacity index $\beta=1.75$ to
extrapolate the \citet{Ossenkopf1994a} opacity to $\kappa_{3mm}=0.0018$ cm$^2$
g$^{-1}$.  Our dust-only 5-$\sigma$ sensitivity limit at 40 K therefore ranges
from $M>7$ \msun (0.5 mJy) to $M>45$ \msun (2.5 mJy) across the map.  If we
were to assume that these are all cold, dusty sources, as is typically (and
reasonably) assumed for local clouds, they would be extremely massive and
dense, with the lowest measurable density being $n(40\mathrm{K}) > 3\ee{6}$
\percc (corresponding to 7 \msun in a 0.5\arcsec radius sphere).  Such extreme
objects are possible, but since we have detected $>100$ of these sources, it
makes sense to evaluate other possibilities.


\subsubsection{Alternative 1: The sources are externally ionized gas blobs}
One possibility is that these sources are not dusty at all, nor pre- or
protostellar, but are instead the brightest compact clumps surrounding \hii
regions.  They would then be analogous to the heads of cometary clouds,
externally ionized globules (``EGGs"), or proplyds, and their observed emission
would give no clue to their nature because the light source is extrinsic.

The majority of the detected sources have size $<4000$ AU, i.e., they are
unresolved.  By contrast, the free-floating EGGs so far observed have sizes
10,000-20,000 AU \citep{Sahai2012a,Sahai2012b}, so they would be resolved in
our observations.  Toward the brightest frEGG in Cygnus X, \citet{Sahai2012b}
measured a peak intensity $S_{8.5 GHz} \approx 1.5$ mJy/beam in a
$\approx3\arcsec$ beam.  Cygnus X is $6\times$ closer that the Galactic center,
so their beam size is the same physical scale as ours.  If the free-free
emission is thin, the brightness in our data would be $S_{95 GHz} =
(95/8.5)^{-0.1} S_{8.5 GHz} = 0.79 S_{8.5 GHz} \approx 1.2$ mJy/beam.  These
frEGGs would be detectable in our data.  Comparison to radio observations
at a comparable resolution will be needed to rule out the externally ionized
globule hypothesis for resolved regions.

If the detected sources were either EGGs or cometary clouds, we would expect
them to be located within \hii regions.  Many of the sources are near \hii
regions, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:coreson20cm}.  However, they are nearly all
associated with a ridge of HC$_3$N emission (Figure \ref{fig:coresonhc3n}).  If
they are deeply embedded within the molecular material, they cannot be
externally ionized.  The current data do not provide enough information on the
geometry of the clouds to rule out the possibility that the point sources are
just illuminated cloud edges, but the fact that the ionized gas is brightest
adjacent to, rather than on top of, the HC$_3$N suggests that the HC$_3$N
traces a full molecular cloud rather than a thin PDR-like layer.

%This
%scale is consistent with that of frEGGs seen in Carina \citep[e.g.][]{Sahai2012a}.
%The flux density of our sources is 1-2 orders of magnitude below what we would
%predict from the dust observed in the \citet{Sahai2012a} object, though the
%free-free... \todo{Look up observed free-free emission from proplyds and frEGGs.
%Could we have frEGGs?}

% The `tadpole' \citep{Sahai2012b} has $S_{22 \mathrm{GHz}} = 30$ mJy at d=1.4 kpc, resolved
% to $\sim10\times10$ arcsec.  In the CMZ... this would be visible.  Maybe compare to Zadeh's
% recent obs of "proplyds"?

% The key requirement, if these are all indeed externally ionized molecular
% blobs, is that of a strong ionizing radiation field.  Indeed, L-band
% observations \citep{Yusef-Zadeh2004a} show that many of these sources are
% located along the outer edges of a large-scale \hii region (Figure
% \ref{fig:coreson20cm}).
% 
% % However, their location poses a problem for the
% % frEGG/proplyd hypothesis: % this next sentence doesn't really make sense...
% %these sources are observed \emph{within} \hii
% %regions, not along their outskirts. 
% However, when analogous structures are present
% along the outskirts of clouds, they are usually accompanied by a larger
% contiguous cloud edge, which results in a continuous sharp-edged bright feature
% corresponding to a PDR.  Such edges are seen in the Orion Bar and M16's
% ``Pillars of Creation''.   We do not observe any such features here.
% 
% We know from our molecular line observations in HC$_3$N that most of the
% continuum sources lay along a molecular ridge (TODO: FIGURE), so it appears
% most of these sources are embedded in molecular material.

\subsubsection{Alternative 2: The sources are \hii regions produced by interloper ionizing stars}
If there is a large population of older, but still ionizing, stars, they could
ignite \hii regions when they fly through molecular material.  See
\ref{sec:theyarehiiregions} for calculations of stationary \hii region
properties.  The main problem with this scenario is the spatial distribution of
the observed sources.  While most of the continuum sources are associated with
dense gas and dust ridges, not all of the high-column molecular gas regions
have such sources in them (i.e., the left and right sides of the image in
Figure \ref{fig:coresonhc3n}, where molecular material is seen with no
associated millimeter sources).  If there is a free-floating population of OB
stars responsible for the 3 mm point source population, their distribution
should match that of the gas.  Also, there is no such population of sources
seen outside of the dense gas in the infrared \citep[TODO: Who has done
infrared studies of Sgr B2?  You can infer what I have stated `by inspection'
of 2MASS, but it would be more straightforward to quote someone else][]{},
which again we should
expect if there is a uniformly distributed population.  

\subsubsection{Alternative 3: The sources are \hii regions produced by recently-formed OB stars}
\label{sec:theyarehiiregions}

For an unresolved spherically symmetric \hii region ($R=4000$ AU), the expected
flux density is $S_{95 \mathrm{GHz}} = 4.7$ mJy for a $Q_{lyc}=10^{47}$ \pers
source (assuming $T_e=7000$ K), and that value scales linearly with $Q_{lyc}$
as long as the source is optically thin.  Rearranging \citet{Condon2007a} equations
4.60 and 4.61:
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{\nu}(Q_{lyc})  = 4.67 \left[1-\exp\left(c_* T_* \nu_* EM_* \right) \right] \nonumber \\
\nu_* = \left(\frac{\nu}{\mathrm{GHz}}\right)^{-2.1} \nonumber \\
T_* = \left(\frac{T_e}{10^4 \mathrm{K}}\right)^{-1.35} \nonumber \\
c_* = -3.28\times10^{-7} \nonumber \\
EM_* = \frac{3 Q_{lyc}}{4 \pi R^2 \alpha_b} \nonumber \\
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha_b=2\ee{-13}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, $Q_{lyc}$ is the count rate
of ionizing photons in $s^{-1}$, and $R$ is the \hii region radius.

An extremely compact \hii region,
e.g., one with $R<100$ AU and corresponding density $n>10^6$ \percc, would be
optically thick and therefore fainter, $S_{95 \mathrm{GHz}}(R=100 \mathrm{AU},
Q_{lyc}=10^{47} \pers)=3.4$ mJy.  Even the brightest O-stars could produce \hii
regions as faint as 0.5 mJy if embedded in extremely high density gas; above
$Q_{lyc}>10^{47}$ \pers, a 25 AU \hii region would be $\sim0.5$ mJy.

Figure \ref{fig:hiibrightness} shows the predicted brightness for various \hii
regions produced by OB stars and the density required for those \hii regions
to be the specified size.  In
order for the detected sources to be O-star-driven \hii regions, with $10^{47}
< Q_{lyc} < 10^{50}$ \pers, they must be optically thick and therefore
extremely compact and dense.  There is a narrow range of late O/early B stars,
$10^{46} < Q_{lyc} < 10^{47}$ \pers, that could be embedded in compact \hii
regions of almost any size and produce the observed range of flux densities.
Anything fainter, later than $\sim$B0 ($Q_{lyc}<10^{46}$ \pers), would be
incapable of producing the observed flux densities.
Any brighter stars would have to be embedded in dust that, at 40 K, would
outshine the \hii region; more likely, such sources would have much hotter dust
and therefore would be much brighter (and more extended) than our observations
allow.

This restrictive parameter space, combined with a steep luminosity
function that implies there are many more sources at slightly lower luminosity,
is evidence against the population being dominated by \hii regions.

\Figure{figures/HII_region_brightness.png}
{Simple models of spherical \hii regions to illustrate the observable
properties of such regions.  The \hii region size is shown by line color; the legend
in the left plot applies to both figures.  (left) The expected brightness temperature (left
axis) and corresponding flux density within a FWHM=0.5\arcsec beam (right axis) as a

(right) The density required to produce an \hii region of that radius.  The
horizontal dashed line shows the density corresponding to an unresolved dust
source at the 5-$\sigma$ detection limit ($\approx0.5$ mJy, or about 10 \msun
of dust,
assuming $T=40$ K).  Above this line, dust emission would dominate over
free-free emission.  The dotted line shows the density required for dust
emission to produce a 10 mJy source at $T=40$ K.  
As seen in the left plot, for any moderate-sized \hii region, $R>100$ AU, a high-luminosity
star ($Q_{lyc} > 10^{47}$ \pers) would produce an \hii region brighter than the
majority of our sample, which includes only a few sources brighter than 10 mJy.
The densities required to produce \hii regions within our observed range
($1<S_\nu<10$ mJy) are fairly extreme, $n\gtrsim10^6$ \percc, for O-stars.}
{fig:hiibrightness}{1}{18cm}


\subsubsection{The sources are protostars}
\label{sec:theyareprotostars}
After ruling out the other hypotheses, we conclude that these sources are
predominantly embedded protostars.  Their emission is likely dust-dominated,
but is probably warmer than the cloud average $\sim20-40$ K.
We test and validate the hypothesis that most or all of the sources
are protostellar in this section.

We cross-matched out source catalog with catalogs of \hii regions and 
methanol masers.  Class II methanol masers are always associated
with sites of high-mass star formation.
The \citet{Caswell2010a} Methanol Multibeam Survey identified 11 sources in our
observed field of view, of which 10 have a clear match in our catalog.
Several other sources in our catalog match known \hii regions from
\citet{Gaume1995a}, mostly associated with the brightest sources in our sample;
these all have $S_{3 \textrm{mm}} > 9$ mJy.


We compare our detected sample to that of the Herschel Orion Protostar Survey
\citep[HOPS;][]{Furlan2016a} in order to get a general sense of what types of
sources we have detected.  We selected this survey for comparison because it is
one of the largest protostellar core samples with well-characterized bolometric
luminosities available.
Figure \ref{fig:hopshist} shows the HOPS source
fluxes at 870\um scaled to 3 mm assuming a dust opacity index $\beta=1.5$,
which is shallower than usually inferred, so the extrapolated
fluxes may be slightly overestimated.  The 870\um data were acquired with a
$\sim20\arcsec$ FWHM beam, which translates to a resolution $\sim1\arcsec$ at
$d_{Sgr B2} = 8.4$ kpc assuming $d_{Orion}=415$ pc, so our beam size is somewhat smaller than
theirs.  The HOPS sources are all fainter than the Sgr B2 sources.  The
brightest HOPS source, with $L_{tot}<2000$ 
\lsun, would only be 0.2 mJy in Sgr B2, or about a 4-$\sigma$
source - below our detection threshold even in the noise-free regions of the
map.  We  conclude that the Sgr B2 sources are much more luminous
and are therefore massive protostars.

\Figure{figures/core_peak_intensity_histogram_withHOPS.png}
{A histogram combining the detected Sgr B2 cores with predicted flux densities
based on the HOPS \citep{Furlan2016a} survey.  The HOPS histogram shows the 870
\um data from that survey scaled to 3 mm assuming $\beta=1.5$.  Every HOPS
source is well below the detection threshold for our observations.}
{fig:hopshist}{1}{15cm}

This conclusion is supported by a more direct comparison with the Orion nebula
as observed at 3 mm with MUSTANG \citep{Dicker2009a}.  Their data were taken at
9\arcsec FWHM resolution, corresponding to 0.44\arcsec at $d_{Sgr B2}$.  The
peak flux density measured in that map is toward Source I, $S_{90 GHz}(d_{Sgr
B2}) = 3.6$ mJy.  Source I would therefore  be detected and would be
somewhere in the middle of our sample.  It is  extended, and the
extended component would be readily detected in our data. 
Since source I is the only known high-mass YSO in the Orion cloud, and it would
be detectable while no other sources in the Orion cloud would be, it appears
safe to conclude that all of our detected sources are MYSOs.
%The M42 nebula would
%also be readily detectable, and is very similar in size and surface brightness
%to the \hii region Sgr B2 \hii T.

The flux density distribution of the non-\hii region sources follows a powerlaw
with slope $\alpha=1.94\pm0.07$ \citep[fitted with the MLE method
of][]{Clauset2007a}.  If we assume that the stellar mass is linearly
proportional to the 3 mm continuum flux density, this measurement implies a
slope shallower than the $\alpha\sim2.35$ expected for a normal IMF.  It is
possible that the IMF is genuinely different from Salpeter here, but it is more
likely that the more massive stars are surrounded by warmer gas.

If we make the very simplistic assumptions that the sources we detect are all
$L\gtrsim2000$ \lsun ($M\gtrsim8 \msun$), 
we can infer the total (proto)stellar mass in the observed region.
Using a \citet{Kroupa2001a} mass function with $M_{max}=200$ \msun, 23\% of
the mass is contained in $M>8\msun$ stars.  Using $M=8\msun$ as the lower-limit
case for each source, the identified sources have total mass $M(>8)=1800\msun$.
The total stellar mass implied is $M_{tot} = 8\ee{3}$ \msun.  If we use the
mean stellar mass for $M>8$ \msun, $\bar{M}=21.1$ \msun, then $M_{tot}=2\ee{4}$
\msun.  These are lower limits in the Sgr B2 N and M regions because our
catalog is incomplete due to confusion and dynamic range limitations.
Additionally, we are using a single-star IMF and our resolution is only $\sim4000$
AU, so it is likely that we have undercounted by $\gtrsim2\times$, since high-mass
stars have a high multiplicity fraction \citep{Mason2009a}.

% COMPARE TO SCHMIEDEKE

We compare our mass estimates to those of \citet{Schmiedeke2016a}, who inferred
stellar masses primarily from \hii region counts.

Cluster M : N(cores)= 10 N(HII)= 13 counted mass=    711.30 inferred mass=   5600.08

\subsection{An examination of star formation thresholds}
\subsubsection{Comparison to other CMZ clouds}
Lada et al, and others, have proposed that star formation can only occur above
a certain density or column density threshold\footnote{Column density is more
commonly used because of its observational convenience, but it is physically
meaningless unless high column density leads to high optical depths and thereby
changes the gas's ability to cool.}.  In G0.253+0.016, very little star formation
has been observed \citep{Longmore2013a,Johnston2014a,Rathborne2015a} despite
most of the cloud existing above the locally measured column density threshold.

Since we have detected substantial ongoing star formation in the form of
high-mass protostars and/or protostellar cores, we can assess where these stars
form and whether the same (lack of) a threshold exists in Sgr B2.  We therefore
plot the column density distribution (flux distribution?) and overlay the
cumulative distribution function of the background brightness around the cores.

Comparing Sgr B2 to G0.253, the majority of the Sgr B2 cloud is brighter and at
higher column than G0.253.  The presence of star formation in Sgr B2 nearly all
occurs at a higher column than exists within G0.253 (Figure
\ref{fig:fluxhist}).  The lack of SF in the brick is therefore consistent with
the active SF in Sgr B2 and the CMZ's higher SF threshold is confirmed.

\subsubsection{Comparison to Lada, Lombardi, and Alves 2010}
In this section, we compare the star formation threshold in Sgr B2 to that in
local clouds performed by \citet{Lada2010a}.  They determined that all star
formation in local clouds occurs above a column density threshold $M_{thresh} >
116$ \msun pc$^{-2}$, or $N_{thresh}(\hh) > 5.2\ee{21}$ \persc assuming the
mean particle mass is 2.8 amu \citep{Kauffmann2008a}.  We first note, then,
that \emph{all pixels} in our column density maps are above this threshold
by \emph{at least} a factor of 10.

However, the CMZ is 8.4 kpc away from us in the direction of our Galaxy's
center, meaning there is a potentially enormous amount of material unassociated
with the Sgr B2 cloud along the line of sight.  This material may have column
densities as low as
5\ee{21} \persc or as high as 5\ee{22} \persc, as measured from relatively
blank regions in the Herschel column density map \citep{Battersby2011a}.  The
former value corresponds to
the background at high latitudes, $b\sim0.5$, while the latter  is
approximately the lowest seen within our field of view. 
%If the higher value is the 
%correct foreground, there must be a perfect vacuum surrounding the dense gas in
%the Sgr B2 cloud - the `hole' seen in Fig...TODO: show a hole figure.
Even with the very aggressive foreground value of 5\ee{22} \persc subtracted,
nearly the whole cloud exists above this threshold.
%We can therefore
%immediately rule out the possibility that there is a universal star formation
%column threshold, since a large fraction of the observed volume exhibits
%no hint at all of star formation activity.
%-What kind of stars are we sensitive to?  Are they?
%(this is now handled above)

The \citet{Lada2010a} sample used Spitzer observations of nearby clouds that
were nearly complete to stars at least as small as 0.5 \msun.  By contrast, as
discussed in Section \ref{sec:theyareprotostars}, our survey is sensitive only
to stars with $M\gtrsim8$ \msun.  The apparently higher threshold either means
that there is a genuinely higher threshold for star formation in the CMZ or
that there is a higher threshold for high-mass star formation that could still
be universal.

\section{Single Dish Combination}
To measure the column density at a resolution similar to \citet{Lada2010a}, we
needed to use ground-based single-dish data with resolution $\sim10\arcsec$.
We combined these images with Herschel data, which recover all angular
scales, to fill in the missing `short spacings' from the ground-based data.

Specifically, we combine the SHARC 350 \um \citep{Dowell1999a} and 
SCUBA 450 \um \citep{di-Francesco2008a} with Herschel 350 and 500 \um data
\citep{Molinari2016a}, respectively.

Combining single-dish with `interferometer' data, or data that are otherwise
insensitive to large angular scales, is not a trivial process.  The standard
approach advocated by the ALMA project is to use the `feather' process, in
which two images are fourier-transformed, multiplied by a weighting function,
added together, and fourier transformed back to image space \citep[see
equations in \S 5.2 of][]{Stanimirovic2002a}.  This process is subject to
substantial uncertainties, particularly in the choice of the weighting
function.  

Two factors need to be specified for linear combination: the beam size of the
`single-dish', or total power, image, and the largest angular scale of the
`interferometer' or filtered image.  While the beam size is sometimes
well-known, for single dishes operating at the top of their usable frequency
range (e.g., the CSO at 350 \um or GBT at 3 mm), there are uncertainties in the
beam shape and area and there are often substantial sidelobes.  In
interferometric data, the largest angular scale is well-defined in the
originally sampled UV data, but is less well-defined in the final image because
different weighting factors change the recovered largest angular scale.  For
ground-based filtered data, the largest recoverable angular scale is difficult
to determine and requires concerted effort
\citep[e.g.,][]{Ginsburg2013a,Chapin2013a}.

To assess the uncertainties in image combination, particularly on the
brightness distribution \citep[e.g.][]{Ossenkopf-Okada2016a}, we have performed
a series of experiments...

EXPERIMENT 1: "SHARC" data with beam overestimated (real = 9, used = 12)
EXPERIMENT 2: "SHARC" data with 50\% flux calibration error
EXPERIMENT 3: "SCUBA" data with 50\% flux calibration error (extrapolation)

...With those experimental results in hand, we combined the SHARC and SCUBA
images with their Herschel counterparts.
