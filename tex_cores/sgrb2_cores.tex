\begin{abstract}
We report ALMA observations at 3 mm  of the extended Sgr B2 cloud. We detected
\ncores compact sources, the majority of which have extents smaller than 5000
AU.  By ruling out alternative possibilities such as externally ionized
globules, we conclude that these sources are predominantly protostars or
centrally condensed prestellar cores.  The spatial distribution of these
sources, which is spread over a $\sim12\times3$ pc region, demonstrates that
Sgr B2 is experiencing a highly extended star
formation event, not just an isolated `starburst' within the protocluster
regions Main (M), North (N), and South (S).  While all of the detected
protostars reside in regions of high column density, not all regions of high
column density
($N(\hh)>10^{23}$ \persc)
contain a high density of
protostars.  {\color{red} We observe a threshold} for high-mass star formation that is
substantially higher than the solar vicinity threshold for star formation, implying
either that high-mass star formation requires a higher column density or that
the star formation threshold in the CMZ is higher than the solar vicinity
threshold.  These observations constitute the largest known single, possibly
coeval to within 1 Myr, sample of forming massive stars.

{fig:overview}{1}{\textwidth}

The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy appears to be overall deficient
in star formation relative to the gas mass it contains \citep{Longmore2013a,
Kauffmann2016a,Kauffmann2016b,Barnes2016c,Barnes2017b}.  This deficiency
suggests that star formation laws, i.e., the empirical relations between
the star formation rate and gas column density, are not universal.  The gas
conditions in the Galactic center are different from those in nearby clouds,
providing a powerful lever arm in a few
parameters \citep[e.g., pressure, temperature, velocity
dispersion;
][]{Kruijssen2013a,Ginsburg2016a,Immer2016a,Shetty2012a,Henshaw2016a} to assess
the influence of environmental effects on star formation.


The observations that have demonstrated the star formation deficiency compare
bulk tracers of star formation to $>0.1$ pc resolution gas observations
\citep[e.g.][]{Barnes2017b}.  More recently, high-resolution observations
of selected clouds in the CMZ have revealed very few star-forming cores
even when examined at high resolution and sensitivity
\citep{Rathborne2014a,Rathborne2015a,Kauffmann2016a,Kauffmann2016b}.  The only
sites with
obvious signs of ongoing star formation along the CMZ dust ridge are the Sgr B2
N (North), M (Main), and S (South) protoclusters \citep[][Figure
\ref{fig:overview}]{Schmiedeke2016a}, 
and, at a much lower level, the 20 \kms and 50 \kms clouds
\citep{Lu2016a,2017a}, and Clouds C, D, and E \citep[][Walker et al, in
prep;]{Ginsburg2015b,Barnes2017b}.  These regions contain a handful of
high-mass cores but only a small number of protostars.

We report the first observations of extended, ongoing star formation in a
Galactic center cloud \emph{not} isolated to a centralized protocluster dust
clump.  We observed a $\sim15\times15$ pc section of the Sgr B2 cloud and
identified star formation along the entire molecular dust ridge known as Sgr B2
Deep South \citep[DS, also known as the `Southern
Complex'][]{Jones2012a,Schmiedeke2016a}).  These observations allow us to
perform the first
star-counting based determination of the star formation rate within the dense
molecular gas of the CMZ.

We adopt a distance to Sgr B2 $D_{\mathrm{Sgr B2}}=\dsgrb$, which is consistent
with Sgr B2 being
located in the CMZ dust ridge.  While \citet{Reid2009a} measure a closer
distance of 7.9 kpc, we use a value closer to the IAU-recommended Galactic
Center distance of 8.5 kpc, accounting for the distance difference of
$\approx100$ pc measured by \citet{Reid2009a}.  Choosing the closer distance
would result in masses and luminosities smaller by 12\%, which would not
affect any of the conclusions of this paper.

We describe the observations in Section \ref{sec:observations}. In this paper,
we focus on the continuum sources, which we identify in Section
\ref{sec:contsources}.  We classify the sources in Section
\ref{sec:classification}.

\section{Observation and Data Reduction}
\label{sec:observations}
\subsection{ALMA data}
Data were acquired as part of ALMA project 2013.1.00269.S (see Table
\ref{tab:observations}).  Observations were taken in ALMA Band 3 with the 12m
Total Power array (not included in this work), the ALMA 7m array, and in two
configurations with the ALMA 12m array.  The setup included the maximum allowed
number of channels, 30720, across 4 spectral windows in a single polarization;
the single-polarization mode was adopted to support moderate spectral
resolution ($\sim1.6$ \kms) across the broad bandwidth.  The basebands were
centered at 89.48, 91.28, 101.37, and 103.23 GHz with bandwidth 1.875 GHz (total
7.5 GHz).

% analysis/measure_dynamic_range.py
The ALMA QA2 calibrated measurement sets were combined to make a single
high-resolution, high-dynamic range data set.  We imaged the continuum jointly
across all four basebands (without excluding
any spectral line regions), and found that the central regions surrounding Sgr B2 M
were severely affected by artifacts that could not be cleaned out.  We
therefore ran 3 iterations of phase-only self-calibration and two iterations of
amplitude + phase self-calibration, the latter using multi-scale
multi-frequency synthesis with two Taylor terms \citep{Rau2011a}, to yield a substantially
improved image (see Appendix \ref{sec:selfcal}).  The total dynamic range,
measured as the peak brightness in
Sgr B2 to the RMS noise in a signal-free region of the combined 7m+12m image,
is 18000 (noise $\sim0.09$ mJy/beam, 0.05 K), while the dynamic range within one
primary beam ($\sim0.5$\arcmin) of Sgr B2M is only 5300 (noise $\sim0.3$
mJy/beam, 0.16 K).  Because of the dynamic range limitations and an empirical
determination that clean did not converge if allowed to go too deep, we cleaned
to a threshold of 0.1 mJy/beam over all pixels with $S_\nu > 2.5$ mJy / beam
as determined from a previous iteration.
The final image used for most of the analysis in this paper was imaged with 
Briggs robust parameter 0.5, achieving a beam size $0.54\times0.46\arcsec$.
% We performed this same
% process for both the longest-baseline data only (resolution $\sim0.5\arcsec$,
% largest angular scale theoretically 15\arcsec\ [the shortest baseline] but more
% practically $\sim7$\arcsec\ [the 5th percentile baseline length]) and the
% merged 7m + two 12m configuration data.  The merged data are more useful for
% studying extended structures but have lower dynamic range, while the
% long-baseline-only data are excellent for extracting and analyzing pointlike or
% compact sources.

{fig:MandNzooms}{1}{\textwidth}

We also produced cubes of all of the spectral lines.  These were lightly
cleaned with a maximum of 2000 iterations of cleaning to a threshold of
100 mJy/beam.  No self-calibration was applied, both because the dynamic range
limitations were less significant and because the image cubes are
computationally expensive to process.
Before continuum subtraction, dynamic range related artifacts similar to those
in the continuum images were present, but these structures are identical across
frequencies, and were therefore removable in the image domain.  We use
median-subtracted cubes for the majority of our analysis, noting that the only
location in which an error $>5\%$ on the median-estimated continuum is expected
is the Sgr B2 North core \citep[][Sanchez-Monge et al. 2017,
submitted]{Sanchez-Monge2017a}.
While many lines were included in the spectral setup, only \cyanoacetylene
J=10-9 is discussed here; of the included lines, it is the brightest and most
widely detected.

\subsection{Other data - Column Density Maps}
\label{sec:colmaps}
We use archival data to create column density maps.   To determine the column
density and dust temperature on large angular scales, we use Herschel Hi-Gal
data \citep{Molinari2010a} to perform SED fits to each pixel (Battersby et al,
in prep).  These fits were performed at 25\arcsec resolution, using the 70, 160,
250, and 350 \um data and excluding the 500 \um channel.  The estimated 
uncertainty is $\sim25\%$, with an upper limit on the systematic uncertainty
of a factor of two (Batterby et al, in prep).


The CSO SHARC data were reported in \citet{Bally2010a} and have a nominal
resolution of 9\arcsec at 350 \um, however, at this resolution,
the SHARC data display a much higher surface brightness than the Herschel
data on the same angular scale.  An assumed resolution of 11.5\arcsec gives a
better surface brightness match and is consistent with the measured scale of
Sgr B2 N in the image.  This calibration difference is likely to have been a
combination of blurring by pointing errors, surface imperfections, the
gridding process, and flux calibration errors.  In any case, the Herschel data
provide the most trustworthy absolute calibration scale, since they were taken
from space and calibrated to an absolute scale using Planck data
\citep{Bendo2013a,Bertincourt2015a}.

The JCMT SCUBA 450 \um data were reported in \citet{Pierce-Price2000a} and
\citet{di-Francesco2008a} with a resolution of 8\arcsec.  We found that the
SCUBA data had a flux scale significantly discrepant from the Herschel-SPIRE 500 \um data,
even accounting for the central wavelength difference.  We had to scale the
SCUBA data up by a factor $\approx3.0$ to make the data agree with the Herschel-SPIRE
images on the angular scales they are both hypothetically sensitive to.
While such a large flux calibration error seems implausible, the measured
FWHM toward Sgr B2 N is approximately 14\arcsec, which means the beam area is $\approx3\times$
larger than the theoretical size.  We attempted to fit several other isolated
sources in the large SCUBA map, and the smallest FWHM we measured was
$\approx10.5$\arcsec.  Between the larger beam area, flux calibration errors
\citep[quoted at
20\percent in][]{Pierce-Price2000a}, and the dust emissivity correction
(35-50\percent for $\beta=3-4$), this large flux scaling factor is 
plausible. This large correction factor is consistent with the large error beam
found by \citet{di-Francesco2008a}, with effective FWHM $\approx17.3$\arcsec,
since they used additional smoothing when creating their maps.


To obtain higher resolution column density maps, we used the combined
Herschel-SPIRE+SHARC and Herschel-SPIRE+SCUBA maps.
%We combined the SHARC and SCUBA data with Herschel SPIRE 350 and 500 \um
%images \citep{Molinari2010a}, respectively.   
We created several column density maps, some assuming arbitrary constant
temperatures equal to the minimum and maximum expected dust temperatures (20
and 50 K), and another using the temperature measured with Herschel
interpolated onto the higher-resolution SCUBA and SHARC grids.  Because of the
interpolation and fixed temperature assumptions, the column maps are not very
accurate and should not be used for systematic statistical analysis of the
column density distribution (i.e., PDF analysis) without careful attention to
the large implied
uncertainties.  However, these higher-resolution data are used in this paper
to provide the best estimates of the local column density around our sample
of compact millimeter continuum sources.
The data combination is discussed in more detail in Appendix
\ref{sec:singledishcomb}.

\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Continuum Source Identification}
\label{sec:contsources}
We selected continuum point sources by eye,
scanning across images with different weighting schemes (different robust
parameters).  An automated selection is not viable across the majority of the
field because there are many extended \hii regions that dominate the overall
map emission.  A future automated selection algorithm may work if images at
comparable resolution at other frequencies become available; the \hii-region
sources could then be excluded.  Additionally, however, there are substantial
imaging artifacts produced by the extremely bright emission sources in Sgr B2 M
($S_{3 mm,max} \approx 1.6$ Jy) and Sgr B2 N ($S_{3 mm,max} \approx 0.3$ Jy)
that make automated source identification particularly challenging in the most
source-dense regions.  All of these features are evident in Figures
\ref{fig:continuumMandN} and \ref{fig:continuumDS}.

Because the noise varies significantly across the map (it is higher near Sgr B2
M), a uniform selection criterion is not possible.  We therefore include two
levels of source identification, `high confidence' sources, which are selected
conservatively in regions of low-background, and `low-confidence' sources that
are somewhat lower signal-to-noise and are often in regions with higher
background (labeled `conservative' and `optimistic', respectively, in Figure
\ref{fig:fluxhist} and \ref{fig:alphahist}).  Both of these selection criteria
are significantly more conservative than a local $5-\sigma$ threshold.

We measure the local noise for each source by taking the median absolute
deviation in an annulus 0.5 to 1.5\arcsec around the source center.
%TODO: check
All but 7 sources have signal-to-local-noise ratios $S/N>7$.  These
sources are all in regions of particularly high background or source
density and therefore have overestimated local noise.

Our selection criteria result in a reliable but potentially incomplete catalog.
The greatest concerns for our completeness are in the densest regions around
Sgr B2 M and N.  In these regions, dynamic range limitations increase the
background noise and make fainter sources difficult to detect, as described in
Section \ref{sec:observations}.  Additionally, they both contain extended
structures, including \hii regions and dust filaments, which likely obscure
compact sources.


Outside of the dense clusters, every locally 5-$\sigma$ peak was visually
inspected.  Peaks that were part of extended structures but not significantly
different from them (e.g., a 5-$\sigma$ peak sitting on a 4-$\sigma$ extended
structure) were excluded.

% The majority of the sources are unresolved.  Some of these sit within regions
% of extended emission.  A small handful were moderately resolved, including some
% of the known \hii regions.

For a subset of the sources, primarily the brightest, we measured the spectral
index $\alpha$ based on CASA \texttt{tclean}'s  2-term Taylor expansion model
of the data (parameters \texttt{deconvolver=`mtmfs'} and \texttt{nterms=2}).
This measurement is over a narrow frequency range ($\approx90-100$ GHz).
\texttt{tclean} produces $\alpha$ and $\sigma(\alpha)$ (error on $\alpha$)
maps, and we used the $\alpha$ value at the position of peak intensity for each
source.  We include in the analysis only those sources with $|\alpha| > 5
\sigma(\alpha)$ or $\sigma(\alpha) < 0.1$; the latter include sources with
$\alpha\sim0$ measured at relatively high precision.  Sixty sources met these
criteria. Several of the brightest sources did not have significant
measurements of $\alpha$ because they are in the immediate neighborhood of Sgr
B2 M or N and therefore have significantly higher background and noise,
preventing a clear measurement.  To check the calibration of the spectral index
measurement, we imaged one of our calibrators, J1752-2956, and obtained a
spectral index $\alpha=-0.62\pm0.14$, consistent with the expected
$\alpha\approx-0.7$ for an optically thin synchrotron source
\citep[e.g.][]{Condon2007a}.  We also note that the \emph{relative} spectral
index measurements in our catalog should be accurate, since all sources come
from the same map with identical calibration.

{A close-in look at the Sgr B2 DS region.  Multiple insets show identified sources
in some of the richer sub-regions.  The points are colored as in Figure

{fig:deepsouthzooms}{1}{\textwidth}

We detected \ncores compact continuum sources, and they are listed
in Table \ref{tab:photometry} {\color{red} This ref is broken and I don't know
why yet.}.  Their flux distribution is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:fluxhist}.  The distribution of their measured
spectral indices $\alpha$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:alphahist}.
Generally, spectral indices $\alpha<0$ indicate nonthermal (e.g., synchrotron)
emission, $-0.1<\alpha<2$ may correspond to free-free sources of various
optical depths, $\alpha=2$ for any optically thick thermal source,
and $\alpha>2$ usually indicates optically thin dust emission.  These indices
will be discussed further in the next Section.


\subsection{Source Classification}
\label{sec:classification}
For the majority of the detected sources, we have only a continuum detection at
3 mm.  No lines are detected peaking toward most of the sources, especially the
faint ones.  In this section, we employ various means to classify the sample of
new sources.

A subset of the detected sources have detections at other bands and can be
classified based on previous literature work, especially those associated with
\hii regions detected at 0.7 and 1.3 cm
\citep{Gaume1995a,Mehringer1995b,de-Pree1996a,de-Pree2015a}, which includes \nhii
sources.  We classified sources as \hii regions if there is a corresponding 0.7
or 1.3 cm source from one of the previous VLA surveys within one ALMA beam
(0.5\arcsec).  The majority of these are unresolved, but we have included \hii
regions with radii up to $\approx1\arcsec$ in our catalog.
Optically thick \hii regions (like any blackbody) have a spectral index $\alpha=2$.
Optically thin \hii regions have a nearly flat spectral index, $\alpha=-0.1$
\citep{Condon2007a}.   The observed sources with \hii region counterparts have
spectral indices consistent with the theoretical expectation for optically thin
\hii regions in Figure \ref{fig:alphahist}.
The existing VLA data do not cover the entire area of our observations, so
we only have a lower limit on the number of \hii regions in our sample.

%regions, it is unclear whether the free-free or dust emission dominates, and

%is an \hii region, but the closest match in our catalog is an SMA-detected dust
%core).
}
{fig:fluxhist}{1}{0.5\textwidth}

We note some properties of dust at 3 mm.   At \dsgrb, a 1 mJy source
corresponds to an optically thin dust mass of $M(40\mathrm{K})=18$ \msun or
$M(20\mathrm{K})=38$ \msun assuming a dust opacity index $\beta=1.75$
($\alpha=3.75$ on the Rayleigh-Jeans tail) to extrapolate the
\citet{Ossenkopf1994a} opacity to $\kappa_{3mm}=0.0018$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$ (per
gram of gas, assuming a dust to gas ratio of 100).  Our dust-only 5-$\sigma$
sensitivity limit at 20 K therefore ranges from $M>19$ \msun (0.5 mJy) to $M>94$
\msun (2.5 mJy) across the map.  If we were to assume that these are all cold,
dusty sources, as is typically (and reasonably) assumed for local clouds, they
would be extremely massive and dense, with the lowest measurable density being
$n(20\mathrm{K}) > 1\ee{8}$ \percc (corresponding to 19 \msun in an
$r=0.2$\arcsec$=1700$ AU radius sphere).  Such extreme objects are possible,
but since we have detected $>100$ of these sources, we evaluate other
possibilities.

We start with a few alternatives we are able to rule out: externally
ionized gas globules, internally ionized \hii regions from an older
generation of `interloper' stars, and internally ionized \hii regions
from a newly-formed generation of massive stars.  We then discuss
why these sources are most likely embedded protostars.


\subsubsection{Alternative 1: The sources are externally ionized gas blobs}
One possibility is that these sources are not dusty at all, nor pre- or
protostellar, but are instead the brightest compact clumps surrounding diffuse
\hii regions.  They would then be analogous to the heads of cometary clouds,
externally ionized globules \citep[``EGGs"][]{Sahai2012a}, or proplyds, and
their observed emission would give no clue to their nature because the light
source is extrinsic.

The majority of the detected sources have size $<4000$ AU, i.e., they are
unresolved.  By contrast, the free-floating EGGs (`frEGGs') so far observed have sizes
10,000-20,000 AU \citep{Sahai2012a,Sahai2012b}, so they would be resolved in
our observations.  Toward the brightest frEGG in Cygnus X, \citet{Sahai2012b}
measured a peak intensity $S_{8.5 GHz} \approx 1.5$ mJy/beam in a
$\approx3\arcsec$ beam.  Cygnus X is $6\times$ closer that the Galactic center,
so their beam size is the same physical scale as ours.  If the free-free
emission is thin, the brightness in our data would be $S_{95 GHz} =
(95/8.5)^{-0.1} S_{8.5 GHz} = 0.79 S_{8.5 GHz} \approx 1.2$ mJy/beam.  These
frEGGs would be detectable in our data.  Comparison to radio observations
at a comparable resolution will be needed to rule out the externally ionized
globule hypothesis for the resolved regions within our sample, but the unresolved
sources are unlikely to be frEGGs.


\FigureOneCol{figures/core_alpha_coloredbyclass.png}
{A histogram of the spectral index $\alpha$ for those sources with a statistically
significant measurement.  The \hii regions cluster around $\alpha=0$, as expected
for optically thin free-free emission, while the unclassified sources cluster
around $\alpha=3$, which is weakly consistent with dust emission.
There are two particularly notable outliers: the source with a highly negative
spectral index, Source 167, has a statistically significant measurement but is
in a region of particularly high extended and diffuse background, so the
measurement may not be reliable.  The other unidentified source with $\alpha\sim-1$
is Source 80, which is very close to the \hii region Sgr B2 S, but is not detected
in the \citet{de-Pree1996a} 1.3 cm data; it may be an \hii region or it may
be contaminated by the nearby \hii region.}
{fig:alphahist}{1}{0.5\textwidth}

If the detected sources were either EGGs or cometary clouds, we would expect
them to be located within diffuse \hii regions.  Many of the sources are near \hii
regions, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:coreson20cmandhc3n}a.  However, they are
nearly all associated with a ridge of HC$_3$N emission (Figure
\ref{fig:coreson20cmandhc3n}b).  If they are deeply embedded within the
molecular material, they cannot be externally ionized.  
%The current data do not provide enough information on the
%geometry of the clouds to rule out the possibility that the point sources are
%just illuminated cloud edges, but 
The fact that the ionized gas is brightest nearby, rather than directly on top
of, the HC$_3$N suggests that the HC$_3$N traces a full molecular cloud rather
than a thin PDR-like layer.

A final point against the externally ionized hypothesis is the observed
spectral indices shown in Figure \ref{fig:alphahist}.  We measured spectral
indices for \nalphas sources, of which \ngttwo have $\alpha>2$.  These sources are
inconsistent with free-free emission and are at least reasonably consistent
with dust emission.
%Of the 20 that are consistent with free-free emission, 11
%are known \hii regions, hinting that our sample is dominated by dusty objects,
%not externally ionized objects.

%This
%scale is consistent with that of frEGGs seen in Carina \citep[e.g.][]{Sahai2012a}.

\subsubsection{Alternative 2: The sources are \hii regions produced by
interloper ionizing stars}
If there is a large population of older (age 1-30 Myr) massive stars, they could
ignite compact \hii regions when they fly through molecular material.  See
\ref{sec:theyarehiiregions} for calculations of stationary \hii region
properties.  The main problem with this scenario is the spatial distribution of
the observed sources.  While most of the continuum sources are associated with
dense gas and dust ridges, not all of the high-column molecular gas regions
have such sources in them (i.e., the left and right sides of the image in
Figure \ref{fig:coreson20cmandhc3n}b, where molecular material is seen with no
associated millimeter sources).  If there is a free-floating population of OB
stars responsible for the 3 mm point source population, if we assume the
spatial distribution of the stars is uniform, the distribution of \hii regions
surrounding them should match that of the gas (since we are assuming the gas and
stars are moving independently).  Also, there is no such population of sources
seen outside of the dense gas in the infrared \citep[TODO: Who has done
infrared studies of Sgr B2?  You can infer what I have stated `by inspection'
of 2MASS, but it would be more straightforward to quote someone else][]{},
which again we should expect if there is a uniformly distributed population.
Finally, the spectral indices discussed above (Figure \ref{fig:alphahist})
suggest the previously-unidentified sources are dust emission sources, not
free-free sources.



\subsubsection{Alternative 3: The sources are \hii regions produced by
recently-formed OB stars}
\label{sec:theyarehiiregions}

We know from previous observations
\citep[e.g.][]{Mehringer1995b,de-Pree1996a,de-Pree2015a} that there is a
substantial population of \hii regions in the Sgr B2 clusters.  The \nhii
sources associated with these previously-identified \hii regions are among the
brightest in our catalog.  We address here whether the remaining primarily
fainter sources could also be \hii regions.

For an unresolved spherically symmetric \hii region ($R=4000$ AU), the expected
flux density is $S_{95 \mathrm{GHz}} = 4.7$ mJy for a $Q_{lyc}=10^{47}$ \pers
source (assuming $T_e=7000$ K), and that value scales linearly with $Q_{lyc}$
as long as the source is optically thin.   We rearrange \citet{Condon2007a}
equations 4.60 and 4.61:
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{\nu}(Q_{lyc})  &=& 4.67 \left[1-\exp\left(c_* T_* \nu_* EM_* \right) \right] \nonumber \\
\nu_* &=& \left(\frac{\nu}{\mathrm{GHz}}\right)^{-2.1} \nonumber \\
T_* &=& \left(\frac{T_e}{10^4 \mathrm{K}}\right)^{-1.35} \nonumber \\
c_* &=& -3.28\times10^{-7} \nonumber \\
EM_* &=& \frac{3 Q_{lyc}}{4 \pi R^2 \alpha_b} \nonumber \\
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha_b=2\ee{-13}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, $Q_{lyc}$ is the count rate
of ionizing photons in $s^{-1}$, and $R$ is the \hii region radius.
The constant $c_*$ was computed by \citet{Mezger1967a} and is never
incorrect by more than $\approx25\%$.

An extremely compact \hii region,
e.g., one with $R<100$ AU and corresponding density $n>10^6$ \percc, would be
optically thick and therefore fainter, $S_{95 \mathrm{GHz}}(R=100 \mathrm{AU},
Q_{lyc}=10^{47} \pers)=3.4$ mJy.  Even the most luminous O-stars could produce \hii
regions as faint as 0.5 mJy if embedded in extremely high density gas; above
$Q_{lyc}>10^{47}$ \pers, a 25 AU \hii region would be $\sim0.5$ mJy.

Figure \ref{fig:hiibrightness} shows the predicted brightness for various \hii
regions produced by OB stars and the density required for those \hii regions
to be the specified size.  In
order for the detected sources to be O-star-driven \hii regions, with $10^{47}
< Q_{lyc} < 10^{50}$ \pers, they must be optically thick and therefore
extremely compact and dense.  There is a narrow range of late O/early B stars,
$10^{46} < Q_{lyc} < 10^{47}$ \pers, that could be embedded in compact \hii
regions of almost any size and produce the observed range of flux densities.
Anything fainter, later than $\sim$B0 ($Q_{lyc}<10^{46}$ \pers), would be
incapable of producing the observed flux densities.
Any brighter stars would have to be embedded in dust that, at 40 K, would
outshine the \hii region; more likely, such sources would have much hotter dust
and therefore would be much brighter (and more extended) than our observations
allow.

The luminosity function of the observed sources is apparently steep, assuming
the flux density distribution (Figure \ref{fig:fluxhist}) represents the
luminosity distribution.  The observed distribution cuts off near our
sensitivity limit, which implies that the steep spectrum should continue to
lower luminosities, and therefore there are many more sources below our
detection threshold than above.  This argument is pure extrapolation, and
therefore could easily be wrong, but if there is a large population of sources
below $<0.5 mJy$, they are too faint to be \hii regions.

This restrictive parameter space, combined with a steep luminosity function, is
evidence against the population being dominated by \hii regions.  The spectral
indices also support this conclusion, since some are steeper than $\alpha>2$
and are therefore inconsistent with free-free emission.

free-free emission.  The dotted line shows the density required for dust
emission to produce a 10 mJy source at $T=40$ K.

As seen in the left plot, for
any moderate-sized \hii region, $R>100$ AU, a high-luminosity star ($Q_{lyc} >
10^{47}$ \pers) would produce an \hii region brighter than the majority of our
sample, which includes only a few sources brighter than 10 mJy.  The electron
densities required to produce \hii regions within our observed range
($1<S_\nu<10$ mJy) are fairly extreme, $n_e\gtrsim10^6$ \percc, for O-stars.}
{fig:hiibrightness}{1}{18cm}


\subsubsection{Our hypothesis: The sources are (mostly) protostellar}
\label{sec:theyareprotostars}
After ruling out the other possibilities, we test and validate the hypothesis
that most or all of the sources are protostellar in this section.


As noted at the top of this section, a cold `prestellar core' at our detection
limit would have $M(20\mathrm{K})\approx20$ \msun.  At these high densities
($n\gtrapprox10^8$ \percc), it is unlikely any such cores are unbound.  If we
assume higher dust temperatures, the inferred gas mass is lower, but an
internal heating source - i.e., a protostar - is required.  The high density
required for our sources results in a very short free-fall timescale,
$t_{ff}\lessapprox6000$ yr, which suggests that the cores are unlikely to be
prestellar cores and instead, even if their emission is dust-dominated, they
contain protostars.  Their emission is likely dust-dominated, but is probably
warmer than the cloud average $\sim20-40$ K \citep[e.g.,]{Ginsburg2016a}.  


We cross-matched our source catalog with catalogs of \hii regions, X-ray
sources, and methanol masers.  Associations with these types of sources can be
used to classify the sources.

Several sources (\nhii) in our catalog match known \hii regions from
\citet{Gaume1995a} to within 0.5\arcsec, most of which are associated with the
brightest sources in our sample; these all have $S_{3 \textrm{mm}} > 9$ mJy.
The \citet{Gaume1995a} catalog does not cover the full observed area, so the
\hii region source association is incomplete.  These sources evidently contain
high-mass young stars, but they are not `protostars'.

Class II methanol masers are exclusively associated with sites of high-mass
star formation.  The \citet{Caswell2010a} Methanol Multibeam (MMB) Survey
identified 11 sources in our observed field of view (their survey covers our
entire observed area), of which \nmasermatch have a clear match to within
1\arcsec of a source in our catalog (the MMB catalog sources have a positional
accuracy of $\approx0.4\arcsec$, but masers may have an extent up to 1\arcsec).
These sources are clearly identified as high-mass protostars.

Some young stars exhibit X-ray emission, including some MYSOs
\citep[e.g.][]{Townsley2014a}, so we searched for X-ray emission from our
sources.  \nxraymatch of the sources have X-ray counterparts in the
\citet{Muno2009a} Chandra point source catalog within 1 \arcsec.  The
\citet{Muno2009a} catalog covers our entire observed area.  The X-ray
associated sources most likely either contain protostars or young stars.


We compare our detected sample to that of the Herschel Orion Protostar Survey
\citep[HOPS;][]{Furlan2016a} in order to get a general sense of what types of
sources we have detected.  We selected this survey for comparison because it is
one of the largest protostellar core samples with well-characterized bolometric
luminosities available.
Figure \ref{fig:hopshist} shows the HOPS source
flux densities at 870\um (from LABOCA on the APEX telescope) scaled to 3 mm
assuming a dust opacity index $\beta=1.5$,
which is shallower than usually inferred, so the extrapolated
fluxes may be slightly overestimated\footnote{We err on the shallower side,
implying that the extrapolated 3 mm fluxes are brighter, since this approach
gives a more conservative view of the detectability of the Orion sources.
In reality, such sources are likely even fainter than predicted here.}.  The
870\um data
were acquired with a $\sim20\arcsec$ FWHM beam, which translates to a
resolution $\sim1\arcsec$ at $d_{Sgr B2} = $\dsgrb assuming $d_{Orion}=415$ pc,
so our beam size is somewhat smaller than theirs.  The HOPS sources are all
fainter than the Sgr B2 sources.  The brightest HOPS source, with
$L_{tot}<2000$ \lsun, would only be 0.2 mJy in Sgr B2, or about a 4-$\sigma$
source - below our detection threshold even in the noise-free regions of the
map.  We  conclude that the Sgr B2 sources are much more luminous and are
therefore massive protostars.

and flat spectrum sources have $-0.3 < \alpha_{IR} < 0.3$. The HOPS histogram
shows the 870 \um data from that survey scaled to 3 mm assuming $\beta=1.5$.
Every HOPS source is well below the detection threshold for our observations.}
{fig:hopshist}{1}{0.5\textwidth}

This conclusion is supported by a more direct comparison with the Orion nebula
as observed at 3 mm with MUSTANG \citep[][Figure
\ref{fig:orioncompare}]{Dicker2009a}.  Their data were taken at
9\arcsec FWHM resolution, corresponding to 0.48\arcsec at $d_{Sgr B2}$.  The
peak flux density measured in that map is toward Source I, $S_{90 GHz}(d_{Sgr
B2}) = 3.6$ mJy.  Source I would therefore  be detected and would be
somewhere in the middle of our sample.  It is  extended, and the
extended component would be readily detected in our data. 
Since Source I is the only known high-mass YSO in the Orion cloud, and it would
be detectable while no other sources in the Orion cloud would be, it appears
safe to conclude that most of our detected sources are MYSOs.
%The M42 nebula would
%also be readily detectable, and is very similar in size and surface brightness
%to the \hii region Sgr B2 \hii T.

brightness and extent to M42; Sgr B2 \hii L is much brighter and is saturated

M42 image is Orion Source I; the images demonstrate that Source I and the entire
M42 nebula would be easily detected in our data.
}
{fig:orioncompare}{1}{0.5\textwidth}

While we have concluded that the sources are dusty, massive protostars, the
spectral indices we measured are somewhat surprising.  Typical dust clouds in
the Galactic disk have dust opacity indices $\beta\sim1.5-2$
\citep{Schnee2010a,Shirley2011a,Sadavoy2016a}.  Our spectral indices are lower
than these, with only 3 sources having measured $\beta=\alpha-2 > 1.5$ (at the
$2\sigma$ level, up to 11 sources are consistent with $\beta=1.5$, but this is
primarily because of their high measurement error).  A shallower $\beta$
implies free-free contamination, large dust grains, or optically thick surfaces
are present within our sources.  Since the above arguments suggest that the
sources are high-mass protostars, the free-free contamination and optically
thick inner region models are both plausible.

\subsection{Source distribution functions and the star formation rate}
\label{sec:distributionsandsfr}

In this section we examine the distribution of observed flux densities and the
implied total stellar masses.  

% The flux density distribution of the non-\hii region sources follows a powerlaw
% with slope $\alpha=1.94\pm0.07$ \citep[fitted with the MLE method
% of][]{Clauset2007a}.  If we assume (incorrectly) that the stellar mass is linearly
% proportional to the 3 mm continuum flux density, this measurement implies a
% slope shallower than the $\alpha\sim2.35$ expected for a normal IMF.  It is
% possible that the IMF is genuinely different from Salpeter here, but it is more
% likely that the more massive stars are surrounded by warmer gas, implying that
% the source mass distribution is steeper than the source flux distribution.

If we make the very simplistic assumptions that the sources we detect all
contain protostars with $L_{bol}\gtrsim2000$ \lsun ($M\gtrsim8 \msun$), we
can infer the total (proto)stellar mass in the observed region.  We assume the
stellar masses based on the arguments in Section \ref{sec:theyareprotostars}:
in order to be detected, the sources must either be active OB stars
illuminating \hii regions or cores, or they must be very compact cores with
$M>10$ \msun of warm dust within $R<4000$ AU.  Note that the mass estimates in
this section are for the \emph{stars}, not their envelopes.

Using a \citet{Kroupa2001a} mass function with $M_{max}=200$ \msun, 23\% of the
mass is contained in $M>8\msun$ stars.  Using the lower-limit mass
of $M=8\msun$ as the mass of each of our \ncores identified sources, we
obtain a total mass $M(>8)=2100$ \msun.  The total stellar mass implied is
$M_{tot} = 9\ee{3}$ \msun.  If instead we assume each source has a mass equal
to the mean stellar mass over the IMF for $M>8$ \msun, $\bar{M}=21.1$ \msun,
then the total inferred stellar mass is $M_{tot}=2.5\ee{4}$ \msun.  These are
lower limits in the Sgr B2 N and M regions because our catalog is incomplete
due to confusion and dynamic range limitations.  Additionally, we are using a
single-star IMF and our resolution is only $\sim4000$ AU, so it is likely that
we have undercounted by $\gtrsim2\times$, since high-mass stars have a high
multiplicity fraction \citep{Mason2009a}.

% COMPARE TO SCHMIEDEKE

For each subcluster identified in \citet[][see Figure
\ref{fig:overview}]{Schmiedeke2016a}, we count the number of \hii regions
identified in our
survey plus those identified in previous works \citep{de-Pree1996a}, and
we count the number of protostellar cores not associated with \hii regions.
To estimate the stellar mass, we assume each core contains a star
with $\bar{M}(8-20) = 12$ \msun and each \hii region contains a $\geq$B0 star
with $\bar{M}(>20) = 45$ \msun.  In Table \ref{tab:clustermassestimates},
this estimate is shown as $M_{count}$.  We also compute the total stellar
mass using the mass fractions $f(M>20) = 0.14$ and $f(8<M<20)=0.09$.
The inferred masses computed from \hii region counts and from core
counts are shown in columns $M_{inferred,\hii}$ and $M_{inferred,cores}$
respectively; $M_{inferred}$ is the average of these two estimates.
If our assumptions are correct and the mass distribution is governed
by a power-law IMF, we expect $M_{inferred,\hii} = M_{inferred,cores}$.
Except for Sgr B2 M, the core-based and \hii-region based estimates agree
to within $\sim25\%$, which is about as good as expected from Poisson
noise in the counting statistics.  

Sgr B2 M has the largest sample in both counts and has a factor of nine
discrepancy. The discrepancy may arise from the combined effects of source
confusion at our 0.5\arcsec resolution and the increased noise around the
extremely bright central region that makes detection of $<2$ mJy sources
difficult.  The majority of pixels within the cluster region have significant
detections at 3 mm, but we do not presently have the capability to distinguish
between extended dust emission, free-free emission, or a confusion-limited
point source population.

We compare our mass estimates to those of \citet{Schmiedeke2016a}, who inferred
stellar masses primarily from \hii region counts.  The last two columns of Table
\ref{tab:clustermassestimates} show the observed and estimated masses based on
\hii region counts.  For Sgr B2 M and N, our results are similar, as expected
since our catalogs are similar.  For S and NE, we differ by a large factor,
primarily because \citet{Schmiedeke2016a} assumed that $M_{min,MYSO}$ and $M_{max}$
were the smallest and largest observed masses in the cluster, while we assumed
$M_{min,MYSO}=8$ \msun and $M_{max}=200$ \msun; i.e., we assumed a spatially
invariant IMF.

% cluster mass estimates table
% stellar_mass_estimates.py
\input{cluster_mass_estimates.tex}

To determine the star formation rate, we need to know the age of the current
star forming burst.  We can use the dynamical model of \citet{Kruijssen2015a}
to get an age of the Sgr B2 cloud $t=0.74$ Myr \citep{Longmore2013a}.  To infer
the star formation rate, we divide the observed mass by this age; the results
are shown in
Table \ref{tab:clustermassestimates}.  This rate assumes that star formation was
initiated at the cloud's most recent pericenter passage.  The total inferred
SFR of the Sgr B2 cloud is 0.036 \msun \peryr, between one quarter and one
half of the total for the CMZ \citep{Longmore2013a,Barnes2017b}.


% While we identified \ncores sources from the continuum data, since we have only
% a single continuum band available, it is difficult to classify most of these
% except to say that they are certainly forming or recently formed stars.

\subsection{An examination of star formation thresholds}
Several authors \citep[e.g.,][]{Lada2010a,Heiderman2010a} have proposed that star
formation can only occur above a certain density or column density
threshold\footnote{Column
density is more commonly used because of its observational convenience, but it
is physically meaningless unless high column density leads to high optical
depths and thereby changes the gas's ability to cool.}. 
We discuss our measurements of column density thresholds in this Section.



\subsubsection{Comparison to Lada, Lombardi, and Alves 2010}
In this section, we compare the star formation threshold in Sgr B2 to that in
local clouds performed by \citet{Lada2010a}.  They determined that all star
formation in local clouds occurs above a column density threshold $M_{thresh} >
116$ \msun pc$^{-2}$, or $N_{thresh}(\hh) > 5.2\ee{21}$ \persc assuming the
mean particle mass is 2.8 amu \citep{Kauffmann2008a}.  We first note, then,
that \emph{all pixels} in our column density maps (Section \ref{sec:colmaps},
Battersby et al, in prep) are above this threshold by \emph{at least} a factor
of 10.

However, Sgr B2 is \dsgrb away from us in the direction of our Galaxy's
center, meaning there is a potentially enormous amount of material unassociated
with the Sgr B2 cloud along the line of sight.  This material may have column
densities as low as
5\ee{21} \persc or as high as 5\ee{22} \persc, as measured from relatively
blank regions in the Herschel column density map \citep{Battersby2011a}.  The
former value corresponds to
the background at high latitudes, $b\sim0.5$, while the latter  is
approximately the lowest seen within our field of view. 
%If the higher value is the 
%correct foreground, there must be a perfect vacuum surrounding the dense gas in
%the Sgr B2 cloud - the `hole' seen in Fig...TODO: show a hole figure.
Even with the very aggressive foreground value of 5\ee{22} \persc subtracted,
nearly the whole Sgr B2 cloud exists above the \citet{Lada2010a} threshold.
%We can therefore
%immediately rule out the possibility that there is a universal star formation
%column threshold, since a large fraction of the observed volume exhibits
%no hint at all of star formation activity.
%-What kind of stars are we sensitive to?  Are they?
%(this is now handled above)

To directly compare our observations to the star formation thresholds reported
in \citet{Lada2010a}, we examined the column density associated with each
millimeter continuum source.  The \citet{Lada2010a} data used a variable
resolution for the column density measurements toward their sample, ranging from
0.06-0.35 pc (equivalent to 1.5 to 9.2\arcsec at a distance of \dsgrb).  The
Herschel data we have available with per-pixel SED fits lack the resolution
needed to make a direct comparison to the Lada et al data set, but the SHARC
and SCUBA data have resolution approximately equivalent to that used in the
Orion molecular cloud in their survey.  We therefore use a range of temperatures
bracketing the observed range in the Herschel maps ($\sim20-50$ K) to produce
column density maps from the SCUBA and SHARC data.  Figure
\ref{fig:corebackgroundcdf} shows the cumulative distribution function of the
column density associated with each identified continuum source; the column
density used is the nearest-neighbor pixel to the source in the column density
maps.  Even using the conservative maximum temperature $T_{dust}=50$ K
(resulting in the minimum column density), all of the sources exist at a column
density an order of magnitude higher than the Lada threshold, and they exist
above that threshold even if the foreground is assumed to be an extreme $5\ee{22}$
\persc.


The \citet{Lada2010a} sample used Spitzer observations of nearby clouds that
were nearly complete to stars at least as small as 0.5 \msun.  By contrast, as
discussed in Section \ref{sec:theyareprotostars}, our survey is sensitive only
to stars with $M\gtrsim8$ \msun.  The apparently higher column threshold either
means that there is a genuinely higher threshold for star formation in the CMZ
or that there is a higher threshold for high-mass star formation that may still
be universal.

{\color{red} Can this discussion be expanded by examining other thresholds?
Diederik suggested Krumholz HMSF threshold, Kauffmann and Pillai threshold should
be examined.}

The SHARC 350 \um and SCUBA 450 \um maps both have higher resolution ($\sim10\arcsec$)
but no temperature information; we used an assumed $T_{dust}=20$ and $T_{dust}=50$ K
to illustrate the range of possible background column densities (hatched
red and blue).  The thick solid red and blue lines show the SHARC and SCUBA column
density images using Herschel temperatures interpolated onto their grids: these
curves are closer to the 20 K than the 50 K curve and serve as the best estimate
column density maps.  The SHARC data fail to go to a cumulative fraction of 1
because the central pixels around Sgr B2 M and N are saturated (the lower temperature
assumptions result in optical depths $>1$, which cannot be converted to column
densities using the optically thin assumption).  The vertical
dashed line shows the $N(\hh)=5.2\ee{21}$ column density threshold from
\citet{Lada2010a}.}

\subsubsection{Comparison to G0.253+0.016}
In G0.253+0.016 (The Brick, G0.253), very little star formation
has been observed
\citep{Longmore2013a,Johnston2014a,Rathborne2014a,Rathborne2015a} despite most
of the cloud existing above the locally measured \citet{Lada2010a} column
density threshold.  The column density distribution function for G0.253
is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bricksgrb2colcompare}.

The \citet{Rathborne2014a} and \citet{Rathborne2015a} data are the deepest
observations of G0.253 so far, with a sensitivity about $4\times$ better than
ours, but a beam of 1.7\arcsec
(similar to that shown in Figure \ref{fig:overview}; compare to Figure 2 in
both Rathborne et al papers).  Despite the higher sensitivity of their data,
they detected only 3 compact continuum sources.  Similarly,
\citet{Kauffmann2013a} detected no compact continuum sources in their SMA and
CARMA observations.  By contrast, even in our coarse resolution data, which
have a worse sensitivity (RMS $\approx 0.25$ mJy beam$^{-1}$, $10\times$ worse
than Rathborne et al), dozens of compact sources are evident.  Our better
resolution was critical for identifying the hundreds of sources we have
identified, but it is nonetheless evident that the star formation activity is
much higher in Sgr B2 than G0.253.


Comparing Sgr B2 to G0.253, the majority of the Sgr B2 cloud is at higher
column than G0.253.  The presence of star formation in Sgr B2 nearly all occurs
at a higher column than exists within G0.253 (Figure
\ref{fig:bricksgrb2colcompare}).  The dearth of observed cores in G0.253 is
therefore seems most easily explained if there is a column density for star
formation that is not reached in G0.253.  Given that the G0.253 observations
were deeper than our own, yet still identified almost no forming stars, it
appears more likely that there is a lack of star formation rather than simply a
lack of high-mass star formation.  Nonetheless, robust verification of this
hypothesis will require much deeper observations.

`background' column densities in Sgr B2 is shown as a thick gray line, showing

\section{Discussion}
We have reported the detection of a large number of point sources and inferred
that they are most likely all high-mass protostars.  These sources universally
reside in gas above $N\gtrsim2\ee{23}$ \persc.  In this section, we discuss
the implications of this apparent threshold for high-mass star formation in the
CMZ.

A theoretical threshold for high-mass star formation, $N > 1$ g \persc ($N(\hh)
> 2\ee{23}$ \persc) was
developed by \citet{Krumholz2008a}.   Nearly all of the sources we have
detected reside above this threshold, and we determined our sources are all
likely to be massive protostars in Section \ref{sec:theyareprotostars}.
However, not all pixels with $N > 1$ g \persc are forming high-mass stars
(Figure \ref{fig:coldistributionwithoutstarformation}).  We
have therefore apparently confirmed that this threshold is a necessary, but not
sufficient, condition for high-mass star formation.


%While there is an apparent column density threshold required for high-mass
%stars to form, that threshold clearly forms only a necessary, not a sufficient,
%condition for star formation.  Figure
%\ref{fig:coldistributionwithoutstarformation} shows that there is abundant
%material within our observed region at $N>1$ g \persc that is not associated
%with ongoing high-mass star formation.  These high-column-density, low
%star-formation regions are also evident in Figure \ref{fig:coresonscubacol},
%which shows that the northern and western regions of the cloud are the
%deficient zones.

and the red dashed region shows those pixels that are within one beam
FWHM of an ALMA source.  While the ALMA sources (high mass protostars and young
stars)
clearly reside in high-column gas, there is abundant high-column material
that shows no signs of ongoing star formation.}

\subsection{What drives star formation in the greater Sgr B2 complex?}
\label{sec:whatdrives}
We have shown that, in addition to the known forming massive clusters,
star formation is ongoing in an extended and elongated region to the north
and south.  Excluding the clusters, most of the newly discovered sources
trace out long and linear features.  Why are the sources aligned?
Was star formation in Sgr B2 triggered by a single event?

There are a few different possible triggers that have been considered in the
literature: pericenter passage \citep{Kruijssen2015a}, cloud-cloud collision
\citep{Hasegawa1994a,Mehringer1997a,Sato2000a}, and expanding shells driven by
massive stars \citep{Martin-Pintado1999a}.  These scenarios are distinct and
apply to different scales.  The pericenter passage model assumes that gas is
fed into a $\sim100$ pc radius non-circular orbit and experiences significant
tidal compression at closest approach to the bottom of the gravitational
potential.  The compression leads to progressively increasing star formation
along the CMZ dust ridge.  Cloud-cloud collision models assume that independent
clouds on different orbits are interacting.  The expanding shell model assumes
the shells are driven by feedback from a previously formed generation of
high-mass stars.

We examine these three possibilities but reach no definitive conclusion about
which process is dominant.

\subsubsection{Pericenter Triggering}
Our observations are reconcilable with a star formation event triggered
at pericenter passage.  If the entire cloud was stable prior to pericenter
passage, at closest approach it would have been simultaneously crushed and 
stretched by shear \citep{Kruijssen2015a}.  This event would have driven
collapse of the whole cloud, with the densest regions collapsing fastest
and possibly forming the clusters we observe today.  This model is discussed
further in Section \ref{sec:clustersandextended}.

\subsubsection{Cloud-cloud collision}
There are no definitive signs of `cloud-cloud collision' or `colliding flows'
in our line or continuum data, though that is largely because all possible
evidence for such flows is highly ambiguous. For example, \citet{Haworth2015c}
show some of the best cases for cloud-cloud collision using the `extended bridge'
in position-velocity between two colliding clouds, but these signatures can be 
completely hidden when multiple clouds exist along a line of sight, as in Sgr B2. 
We cannot rule out cloud-cloud collision, but neither can we provide evidence
to support it.

Most of the notable kinematic features evident in the dense gas images can be
attributed to expanding \hii regions or otherwise feedback-driven flows (see
Section \ref{sec:expandingshells}).  While interacting independent gas streams
are a possible agent affecting Sgr B2, their effects are not obvious in our
core catalog or in the gas data cubes.

We note that some `colliding flows' are expected in almost any collapse
scenario.  For example, simulations of a cloud passing through Galactic
pericenter (Kruijssen et al. in prep.; Dale et al. in prep.) show that some
material is ejected during this passage that later collapses back onto the
original cloud.  It is possible that any apparent colliding flows
\citep[e.g.][]{Sato2000a} are a relic of this process.

\subsubsection{Expanding Shells}
\label{sec:expandingshells}
There is evidence of expanding shells in Sgr B2, but 
these shells are not uniformly sites of star formation.
There are four shell examples we consider: Sgr B2 DS, Sgr B2 N/NE,
Sgr B2 E, and Sgr B2 W.  Two of these (N/NE and DS) show signs
of star formation, two (E and W) do not.

There is extended ionized emission in Sgr B2 Deep South that appears to be a
bubble surrounded by the millimeter continuum sources.  While this region looks
like a normal \hii region in the 12\arcsec resolution 20 cm
VLA data in Figure \ref{fig:coreson20cmandhc3n}, the 3 mm continuum reveals long
filamentary features reminiscent of the Galactic center arched filaments.  By
analogy, they may be magnetically dominated regions, but there must be some
central source of ionizing radiation or energetic particles.  Whatever the
driver, it is possible that an expanding bubble of hot gas has compressed
the molecular material along the ridge where we observe star formation.
However, the ridge of millimeter sources extends well above the apparent bubble
edge, so it is unlikely that the entire DS ridge was driven by a single
coherent expanding bubble.

By contrast, the Sgr B2 North bubble does not contain any ionized emission.  It
contains fewer total sources, which trace the edge of an expanding bubble
previously noted by \citet{de-Vicente1997a}.  The coincidence of star forming
cores along the edge of a bubble again suggests some sort of compressional
triggering.

However, while both N/NE and DS show circumstantial, morphological evidence
for a compressional event, there are other regions within our map that show
the same general morphology in the gas yet exhibit no star formation.
Sgr B2 E and W are the regions east and west of the central ridge, respectively.

Shell-like features in Sgr B2 E can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:hc3nonscuba}.
The molecular gas, as traced by \cyanoacetylene in this case, outlines bubble edges to
the east of Sgr B2 M: the \cyanoacetylene outlines a cavity in the column density map.
The edge of this eastern bubble has a lower average column density than either
the northern Sgr B2 NE or the Sgr B2 DS regions, and it shows no signs of
ongoing star formation. 

In Sgr B2 W, there is a secondary ridge of \cyanoacetylene emission paralleling
the central ridge.  No MYSOs are detected in this ridge.


We observe that some sources appear to be associated with shells, but there are
some shells that have no associated ongoing star formation.  Most of the
observed star formation is not along shell edges.  We therefore conclude that,
while the expanding shells may have some effect on where MYSOs are forming, it
appears that these shells do not provide a sufficient condition to drive star
forming bursts.

seen surrounding cavities in the SCUBA column density map on the east side of

less evident in this velocity-integrated view.  The important feature discussed
in Section \ref{sec:whatdrives} is the differing column density around each of
the bubbles.  The right figure has the cores overlaid as green dots,
showing that the 3 mm sources closely trace the molecular gas, but not all
dense molecular gas contains cores or protostars.}
{fig:hc3nonscuba}{1}{0.5\textwidth}

\subsection{The clusters and the extended population}
\label{sec:clustersandextended}
We noted in Section \ref{sec:distributionsandsfr} that the \hii-region-inferred
protostellar mass matches the core-inferred protostellar mass to within a
factor of 2 in the whole Sgr B2 cloud and the individual clusters excepting Sgr
B2 M.  In Sgr B2 M, the \hii-region inferred mass is $\sim9\times$ greater than
the core-inferred mass.  While the lack of faint sources in Sgr B2 M could
be an observational limitation, it may be a real effect signifying an evolutionary
difference.

Sgr B2 M has more \hii regions and is more centrally condensed than any of the
other clusters and the distributed star forming population.  Assuming that \hii
regions represent a later stage in protostellar evolution than the dusty
protostellar core stage, this difference implies that Sgr B2 M is older than
Sgr B2 N and the distributed protostar population.  By contrast, along the Sgr
B2 DS ridge, there are no \hii regions, but there are $\sim100$ high-mass
protostars, which implies that these protostars began their formation nearly
simultaneously.

The large number of probable protostars observed along an elongated ridge
allows us to estimate an upper limit on their age.  Assuming all of these
forming stars are bound to the cloud and/or central clusters, they should
approach a spherical distribution within about one crossing time
\citep{Efremov1998a}.  If we assume the turbulent velocity dispersion is
$\sigma_{1D}\approx10$ \kms \citep[e.g.][]{Henshaw2016a}, and the length of the
DS ridge is $L\approx10$ pc, the upper limit on the formation time of the
protostars is $L/\sigma_{1D}<1$ Myr.  Given the tight alignment of the
protostars with the gas ridge (Figures \ref{fig:coreson20cmandhc3n} and
\ref{fig:hc3nonscuba}), it is  possible to establish a lower upper
limit.  Most of the sources are within $r<0.5$ pc of the `ridge', which
suggests an upper age limit $t<r/\sigma_{1D}=5\ee{4}$ yr; however, if
the sources have a lower velocity dispersion, this limit would be higher.
Nonetheless, the DS ridge sources appear to be recently formed.

The expanding \hii regions observed around Sgr B2 M and N (and assumed to be
associated with them) give a lower limit on their ages.  The HII regions I, J,
A1, and K4 have radii $r\approx0.1$ pc \citep{Gaume1995a}, suggesting their
ages are at least $t>10^5$ yr assuming they are expanding into 
a density $n\gtrsim10^5 \percc$ \citep{de-Pree1995a,Schmiedeke2016a}.
The clusters therefore appear to be somewhat older than the ridge sources.

% This argument doesn't work for me.
% If we assume the turbulent velocity dispersion is $\sigma_{1D}\approx10$ \kms
% \citep{Henshaw2016a}, and the crossing time is an upper limit on the age spread
% \citep[e.g.][]{Efremov1998a}, we can infer the age spread in the clusters
% compared to that in the whole cloud.   The total size scale of the Sgr B2 cloud
% is $\sim10$ pc, which yields an ag spread upper limit $\lesssim 1$ Myr.  The
% clusters are much more compact, with $r<1$ pc, implying an age spread $<0.1$
% Myr.  

The relative ages of M and the rest of the region (i.e., Sgr B2 M is apparently
older) suggest two possibilities for their formation history.  If we take the
ages at face value, Sgr B2 M must have collapsed first to form stars in an
early event, then sometime later the DS ridge collapsed to form stars in a
later event.  A second possibility is that the overall collapse of both Sgr B2
M and DS began at the same time, but the Sgr B2 M region was denser and
therefore had a shorter collapse time, which is predicted by hierarchical
cluster formation models to lead to higher star formation efficiencies
\citep{Kruijssen2012a}.  Our catalog does not allow us to distinguish these
possibilities.  However, the latter scenario would predict that the cloud
should be in a state of global collapse, with the least dense regions
collapsing most slowly.  This collapse has been suggested to be ongoing in CMZ
clouds by \citet{Walker2015a,Walker2016a} and may leave detectable kinematic
signatures (e.g., self-absorption in moderately optically thick lines) in the
dense gas.

\section{Conclusions}
We have reported the detection of \ncores 3 mm point sources in the extended
Sgr B2 cloud and determined that the majority are high-mass protostellar
cores.  This survey represents the first large population of protostars
detected in the Galactic center and represents the largest sample yet reported
of high-mass protostars.

The large population of high-mass protostellar cores indicates that the entire
Sgr B2 cloud, not just the well-known clusters N, M, and S, is undergoing a
burst of star formation.  More than half of the currently forming generation of
stars is not associated with any of the clusters but is instead part of the
extended burst, as is predicted by models of hierarchical star and cluster
formation.

Using Herschel, SCUBA, and SHARC data, we have measured a threshold for
high-mass star formation analogous to that done in local clouds by
\citet{Lada2010a}.  We find that there are no high-mass protostars in gas below
$N<10^{23}$ \persc, and half are found above $N>10^{24}$ \persc, at a
resolution of $\approx10\arcsec=0.4$ pc.  It is not yet clear whether
there is a higher threshold for low-mass star formation, but the threshold
for high-mass star formation appears consistent with that theorized for
Galactic plane conditions.

The large detected population of high-mass protostars implies a much larger
population of as-yet undetectable lower-mass protostars.  Future ALMA and JWST
programs to probe this population would provide the data needed to directly
compare star formation thresholds in the most intensely star-forming cloud in
our Galaxy to those in nearby clouds.

\section{Single Dish Combination}
\label{sec:singledishcomb}
To measure the column density at a resolution similar to \citet{Lada2010a}, we
needed to use ground-based single-dish data with resolution $\sim10\arcsec$.
We combined these images with Herschel data, which recover all angular
scales, to fill in the missing `short spacings' from the ground-based data.

Specifically, we combine the SHARC 350 \um \citep{Dowell1999a} and 
SCUBA 450 \um \citep{Pierce-Price2000a,di-Francesco2008a} with Herschel 350 and
500 \um data \citep{Molinari2016a}, respectively.

Combining single-dish with `interferometer' data, or data that are otherwise
insensitive to large angular scales, is not a trivial process.  The standard
approach advocated by the ALMA project is to use the `feather' process, in
which two images are fourier-transformed, multiplied by a weighting function,
added together, and fourier transformed back to image space \citep[see
equations in \S 5.2 of][]{Stanimirovic2002a}.  This process is subject to
substantial uncertainties, particularly in the choice of the weighting
function.  

Two factors need to be specified for linear combination: the beam size of the
`single-dish', or total power, image, and the largest angular scale of the
`interferometer' or filtered image.  While the beam size is sometimes
well-known, for single dishes operating at the top of their usable frequency
range (e.g., the CSO at 350 \um or GBT at 3 mm), there are uncertainties in the
beam shape and area and there are often substantial sidelobes.  In
interferometric data, the largest angular scale is well-defined in the
originally sampled UV data, but is less well-defined in the final image because
different weighting factors change the recovered largest angular scale.  For
ground-based filtered data, the largest recoverable angular scale is difficult
to determine and requires concerted effort
\citep[e.g.,][]{Ginsburg2013a,Chapin2013a}.

To assess the uncertainties in image combination, particularly on the
brightness distribution \citep[e.g.][]{Ossenkopf-Okada2016a}, we have performed
a series of experiments combining the Herschel with the SCUBA data using
different weights applied to the SCUBA data.  As discussed in Section
\ref{sec:observations}, we empirically determined the scale factor required for
the best match between SCUBA and Herschel data was $3\times$, which is
shockingly large but justifiable.  In the experiment shown in Figure
\ref{fig:feathercompare}, we show the images and resulting histograms when we
combine the Herschel data with the SCUBA data scaled by a range of factors from
$0.5\times$ to $10\times$.  The changes to the high end of the histogram are
dramatic, but the middle region containing most of the pixels (and most
relevant to the discussion of thresholds in the paper) is hardly affected.
Additionally, we show the cumulative distribution function of core background
surface brightnesses (as in Figure \ref{fig:corebackgroundcdf}), showing again
that only the high end is affected.

The numbers above each panel show the scale factor applied to the SCUBA data
before fourier-combining it with the Herschel data.  The factor of 3 was used
in this paper and shows the most reasonable balance between the high-resolution

fiducial scale factor of 3 is shown in black in all panels.  The solid lines

\section{Self-calibration}
\label{sec:selfcal}
We demonstrate the impact of self-calibration in this section.  The adopted approach
used three iterations of phase-only self-calibration followed by two iterations of
phase and amplitude self-calibration.  Each iteration involved slightly
different imaging parameters.  The final, deepest clean used a threshold mask
on the previous shallower clean. The script used to produce the final images is
available at
\url{https://github.com/keflavich/SgrB2_ALMA_3mm_Mosaic/blob/\githash/script_merge/selfcal_continuum_merge_7m.py}.
The effects are shown with a cutout centered on the most affected region around
Sgr B2 M in Figure \ref{fig:selfcalprogression}.

the 2.5 mJy level, and finally, a sixth iteration of phase and amplitude

corresponding residual images.}

\section{Photometric Catalog}
We include the full catalog in digital form
(\url{https://github.com/keflavich/SgrB2_ALMA_3mm_Mosaic/blob/master/tables/continuum_photometry_withSIMBAD_andclusters.ipac}).
Table \ref{tab:photometry} shows
the brightest 35 sources; the rest are included in a digital-only catalog.
Sources are labeled based on an arbitrary source
number plus any pre-existing catalog name.  If a source is associated with a cluster,
it has an entry corresponding to that cluster in the \texttt{Cluster} column;
association is determined by checking whether a source is within a particular distance
of the cluster center as defined by \citet{Schmiedeke2016a}.  A source
\texttt{Classification} column is included, which states whether the source
is a strong or weak detection, whether it has an X-ray association, whether it
has a maser association, and its SIMBAD classification if it has one.
Measurements reported include the peak flux density $S_{\nu,max}$, the
corresponding brightness temperature $T_{B,max}$, the integrated flux density
within a beam (0.5\arcsec) radius, the background RMS flux level $\sigma_{bg}$
as an estimate of the local noise, the spectral index $\alpha$ and the error on
that $E(\alpha)$.  Mass and column density estimates are given for an assumed
temperature $T=40$ K ($M_{40K}$ and $N(\hh)_{40K}$); for sources with
$T_{B,max}\gtrsim20$ K, these estimates are unlikely to be useful since the
assumed temperature is likely to be much lower than the true temperature.
For sources with $T_{B,max}>40$ K, it is not possible to measure a mass
assuming $T=40$ K.
